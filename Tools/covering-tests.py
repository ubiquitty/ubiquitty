"""covering-tests.py — the tests that cover what this branch changed.

Choosing which tests to run by thinking about the change is how a change
lands with its own test unrun. A change to the box diagonals can run the
stroke profile, the rasterizer and the ranges — every box test its author
reasons their way to — and not `test_boxglyph_golden`, which is the one that
records the draw commands themselves, so it goes red on main instead of on the
branch. `Tests/coverage/covering-tests.tsv` already knows: it lists that test
against `Source/Core/Rendering/BoxDrawCommands.cpp`, and this reads it.

    Tools/covering-tests.py                    the tests covering this branch
    Tools/covering-tests.py --since <ref>      against another base
    Tools/covering-tests.py <path>...          for named files
    Tools/covering-tests.py --run              run them, building first
    Tools/covering-tests.py --uncovered        only the changed files nothing covers

Two limits, both printed with the answer rather than left to be discovered.

The index is built by the coverage job, so it lags main. A stale one names
fewer tests than the change deserves, never more — its answer is a floor and
never a ceiling, which is the safe direction, and it means the drift makes
this weaker rather than wrong.

The index holds unit tests and no snapshot case, so it cannot answer which
goldens a change moves. A branch can be clean on every test named here and
still move a golden on an arm nobody ran, including a case whose subject it
never touches. The snapshot arms are selected separately, by folder, in
Scripts/pre-push-gates.sh.
