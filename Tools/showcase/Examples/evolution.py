"""The evolution of the terminal, played on the terminal.

A title sequence, nine chapters, a credits roll, and a hand-off to the
shell. One thing travels through every era: HELLO, WORLD, typed on paper in
1963, drawn by a storage tube's beam, looped on a phosphor screen, surviving
a selective erase, printed in colour, set in eight scripts, built by a
shell that talks back, and at last running in a session that outlives the
window watching it. Each chapter is drawn only with the sequences its era
brought and the terminal still honours. Every cut is a wipe or a dissolve
under synchronized output, every card counts its year up in double height,
and the score is a tracker's piece played by DECPS, the VT520's play-sound
sequence with Ubiquitty's voices and channels, cued on a timeline under the
action.

    python3 evolution.py                       the director's cut, about two minutes
    python3 evolution.py --cut short           the first-launch cut, under a minute
    python3 evolution.py --chapter tektronix   one chapter (names: --list)
    python3 evolution.py --reduced-motion      cuts for dissolves, stills for fades
    python3 evolution.py --silent              no score
    python3 evolution.py --dump DIR            one .ans per chapter, for --snapshot
    python3 evolution.py --bake FILE           a POSIX sh player with no Python in it

Any key skips a chapter and q leaves. The persistence chapter starts a
private ubiquitty-host of its own, in a directory of its own with a token
of its own, and stops it afterwards; where no host can be found it plays
the same scene from a script and says so. Stdlib only, Python 3.8+. The
stage is 80x24 cells, centred in a larger window; a smaller window gets
the short cut with reduced motion.

    weights and mathematics: DEC's double height and double width, OSC 66
    sized text where the terminal draws it, the SGR weights and the variable
    axis, then display settings a foundry would show. Plate II is styles,
    rules and colour; Plate III, where sized text is drawn, is proportional
    runs; Plate IV is boxes, blocks and separators. The short cut shows the
    first plate.
