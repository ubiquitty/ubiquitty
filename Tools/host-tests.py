"""host-tests.py — build and run a subset of the host tests in this checkout's own build root.

`Scripts/run-tests.sh` hands the CMake-covered tests to ctest only on a full
run, and a full run builds every test in the tree before it answers a question
about three of them. Iterating on a change means the configure line the runner
uses, the build of just the targets the question needs, and `ctest -R`; each
worktree derives its own build root and a fresh one needs the QUIC prefix a
sibling checkout already built. That is four things spelled by hand per
worktree, and the spellings drift.

This does them once, the runner's way:

  Tools/host-tests.py 'vt100_modes|sixel_lifecycle'   # build those, run those
  Tools/host-tests.py --build-only test_terminfo       # the target, no run
  Tools/host-tests.py --list 'sync'                    # what the pattern selects

The configure is the one `run-tests.sh` performs for its ctest handoff (Core
frontend, tests on, Debug, compile commands), issued only when the build root
has no cache yet or its cache belongs to another checkout. The QUIC prefix is
the one every build script names, this checkout's build root, so a checkout
never builds against a directory another worktree happens to hold. Targets are
the tests the pattern selects whose names are build targets; shell stanzas are
run by ctest through their own fixture. The setup fixture that rebuilds every
test is excluded, because the targets were just built.

Exit status is ctest's. Stdlib only.
