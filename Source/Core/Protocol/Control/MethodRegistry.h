// The one table of every operation Ubiquitty exposes to people and agents:
// the control socket's methods, `ubq`'s command-line verbs, and its
// MCP tools. Each entry carries a one-sentence description, a JSON Schema for
// its parameters and one for its result, an example that satisfies both, and
// the principals that may call it. An operation a Sync connection may call
// also names the roles that may call it and the scope the call needs, which is
// the whole of what the host checks before serving it.
//
// The surfaces read from here rather than restating it: the control socket
// validates every request's parameters against the entry's schema before any
// effect and answers `describe` and `list` from the table; the MCP server's
// `tools/list` is generated from the entries that name a tool, and a tool's
// arguments are validated the same way. `Scripts/check-method-registry.py`
// refuses a control-socket method, a command-line verb or an MCP tool that is
// dispatched without an entry, so a surface cannot grow an operation the
// registry does not describe.
//
// Entries are written one field per line, `.name = "..."`, because the gate
// reads them as text.
