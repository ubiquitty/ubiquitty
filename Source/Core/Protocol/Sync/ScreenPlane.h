// Sync/ScreenPlane.h — the host's publisher and the client's replica of one
// pane's screen plane: the checkpoint, updates, and the state digest that
// checks both (Docs/sync.md §6.2, §7.4).
//
// The host keeps, per pane, the dictionaries, both screens' rows as last
// encoded, and the state blocks of the frame it last captured. A row's cached
// record is reused only after a memcmp of the cells and row facts it was
// encoded from, so the row hash is a diff key and never what decides a row is
// unchanged. A frame is captured once and every attachment's update is cut
// from that capture, so one encoded row serves every attachment.
//
// A checkpoint is self-contained: it defines every dictionary entry of the
// epoch, and carries both screens, the modes, the palette, the cursor and
// every per-screen and character state `CheckpointLedger.h` classifies as
// carried. Of the history it carries only the address — the epoch and the
// head — since the lines travel on the history plane (HistoryPlane.h). An
// update brings one attachment from what it holds to the captured frame: the
// definitions it lacks, the state blocks whose bytes moved, and the rows of
// either screen whose hashes moved. Only a change no update can say — the
// geometry, the dictionary epoch, a proportional run's text — needs a
// checkpoint.
//
// Both kinds end with the state digest of what they produce. A client
// computes it from the bytes it received — the hash of each row record and
// block as it arrived, the hashes it already held for what did not travel —
// and applies nothing unless it matches. Apply is transactional: a body is
// decoded and checked whole before the terminal is touched.
//
// Body grammars:

//
// Op 7 is unassigned: it carried history lines before the history plane did.
// A `screen` byte is 0 for the active screen and 1 for the other.
//
// `Spans` and `ScrollRect` say a row in terms of the row the client holds, so
// they go only in a chain update, and only to a client whose `Greet` names
// them among its capabilities. `Spans` rewrites cells of a row whose hash is
// `baseHash`: each span's record, decoded into `cells` cells, replaces the
// row's cells from `column`, and the row's hash becomes `rowHash`; its line
// attribute, flags and mark stay. `ScrollRect` moves the rows `top` to
// `bottom` of a screen by `delta`, row `r` taking row `r + delta`'s cells and
// hash; a row whose source falls outside the rectangle is revealed blank, with
// hash 0, and a later op writes it. A `ScrollRect` precedes every row op of
// its screen, at most one per screen, and no `Spans` names a row it moved.
//
// A checkpoint's links are the host's live link ring in ring order, so the
// client's ring evicts what the host's evicts. An update's ops come in that
// order: definitions, blocks, scrolls, rows. `Definition` and the `RichText`
// block's grammar are in `RichTextForm.h`; a document is defined once per
// attachment, before the block that places it.
//
// Each RowRecord inside a body travels as `bytes`, so its hash covers exactly
// the record. The state digest is XXH3-128 over
//
//     activeScreen:u8 rows:u16 columns:u16
//     rowHash × rows (active screen), rowHash × rows (inactive screen)
//     blockHash × 7 (in `StateBlock` order)
//
// The digest has no history term (Docs/sync.md §6.2): history is checked by
// each line's own hash and by what the client acknowledges.
