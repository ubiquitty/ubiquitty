// - Channel 0 is the connection; a channel n ≥ 1 is a pane handle a `PaneBind`
//   bound. A kind belongs to one of the two, and an envelope pairing a kind

// - The lane a frame rides is implied by its kind and never encoded.
// - The body cap is what keeps one frame from holding the stream: at most
//   65,535 bytes, so a payload above it travels as a bulk transfer, chunked.
//
// A reader fails closed: a length above the cap, an unknown kind, an overlong
// varint or a channel of the wrong scope stops the decoder for good, and the
// connection answers it with `Bye`. Nothing after a failure is read, so a
// hostile length can never make the reader buffer more than one capped frame.
