// Sync/Connection.h — the host's and the client's ends of one Sync
// connection: the handshake, the screen plane's sender and receiver, pacing
// and the lanes (Docs/sync.md §6.2–6.5, §7.2–7.4).
//
// Both ends are transport-free state machines. The owner feeds them the bytes
// and datagrams it reads, with the time, and moves the bytes they produce:
// the host's stream one frame at a time through `popStreamFrame`, so the
// lanes decide what goes next, and datagrams whole.
//
// **Handshake.** The client opens with `Greet` and the wire version it speaks;
// the host answers `Welcome` with its own, or `Bye{VersionMismatch}` when the
// two differ, and a client refuses a `Welcome` at another version the same way
// (Envelope.h).
//
// **Baselines.** The host keeps, per pane per attachment, the generation it
// last sent and the one the client last acknowledged, with the row hashes of
// each, and of every generation sent since the acknowledgement.
//
// - On a stream-only connection every update is a *chain* update from the
//   sent generation, which the stream delivers in order. A client that
//   skipped generations gets the rows whose hashes moved, never a forced
//   checkpoint.
// - On a connection with datagrams, once the client has acknowledged a
//   checkpoint every update is a *superset* update from the acknowledged
//   generation: it carries every row that differs between the newest frame
//   and any generation the client may hold — the acknowledged one or one sent
//   since — so it applies on any of them, and a lost datagram costs only the
//   next update. It travels as a datagram when it fits, on the stream
//   otherwise. The acknowledged generation moves only on an `Ack`, never
//   because a datagram was queued.
// - A checkpoint goes as a bulk transfer; until the client acknowledges it,
//   updates chain from it on the stream, and the client buffers them behind
//   the transfer.
//
// **Pacing.** One window bounds every frame the connection sends: updates,
// checkpoints and the pane's typed records. An update
// is encoded only when the window is open and no update of the pane waits for
// the transport, and sent only when it fits; otherwise the attachment is owed
// and nothing queues. When an `Ack` opens the window, one fresh update goes
// from the sent generation to the newest. No more than one update leaves per
// refresh interval the client reported, two under power saving. A checkpoint
// standing in for an update is paced as the update would be, and one the
// client asked for goes at once; either way an attachment has at most one
// checkpoint body queued, so a newer one waits for the older to leave rather
// than queuing behind it.
//
// **Owed order** (Docs/sync.md §6.4). When the window opens, the panes
// holding input — written to the program after the generation last sent —
// are served first, in bind order; the rest by deficit round-robin over the
// bytes each was sent, so a flooding pane never delays the echo beside it and
// panes that all flood share the window by bytes. Service stops at the first
// frame the window refuses: a smaller frame of a later pane slipping into the
// room would delay the one ahead of it.
//
// **Records.** Pane facts and status precede the pane's screen (§7.8). Each
// published revision replaces the one still owed, so a stalled reader receives
// the newest records when its window opens. Larger typed bodies travel under
// their own announced, bounded bulk transfers.
//
// **Drift.** The client checks every update and checkpoint against the
// digest it carries, and on a mismatch asks for one checkpoint with `Resync`.
// Until a checkpoint applies it ignores updates, so a mismatch costs exactly
// one `Resync` however many updates were already in flight.
//
// The screen plane carries what `ScreenPlane.h` encodes: a checkpoint of the
// whole pane, and updates that carry the rows of both screens, the state
// blocks whose bytes moved and the history appended since the base, so a
// screen switch travels as an update. A pane whose geometry or dictionary
// epoch moved is brought up by a checkpoint.
