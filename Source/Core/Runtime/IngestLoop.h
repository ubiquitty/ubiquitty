// Source/Core/Runtime/IngestLoop.h — the sequential poll-and-drain loop, lifted
// out of the Metal arm's bridge so the tuning is written down once rather than
// re-derived by the next frontend. Every decision here was measured there.
//
// The Metal arm is the only consumer today. The GTK arm drives Core straight
// from the PTY on its main loop and has no ingest thread to give this, so the
// flood pipeline does not reach it.
//
// The OS lives behind PAL: the wait is ``PAL::waitForReadiness`` and the
// cross-thread wake is a ``PAL::Waker``, so this header names no descriptor
// and no syscall. What stays with the platform: the thread and its scheduling
// class (the Metal arm pins its ingest queue to user-initiated so the parser
// is not scheduled onto efficiency cores), and the hop from the deliver hook
// to the main thread.

namespace Ubiquitty::Runtime {

// Coalesced-delivery floor. During a flood, drains complete back-to-back and
// a main hop per drain queues observer bookkeeping faster than the display
// consumes it. Microseconds, because the pacing clock is the wrapping
// monotonic counter and an unsigned delta is wrap-safe.

// loop stalls the WRITER whenever it parses. Power of two for index masking.

// empty ring the parser is waiting on this very read. The wait pays only on a
