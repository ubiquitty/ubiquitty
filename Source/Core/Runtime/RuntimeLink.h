// The per-pane cross-thread seam between the off-main ingest/writer (owning
// Ubiquitty::Terminal under the model lock) and the main-thread frontend. TWO
// lock-free primitives, portable (no threading types beyond <atomic>):
//   (R) SnapshotPublisher<T> — writer publishes a versioned snapshot; any reader
//       reads it lock-free + tear-free (model->main).
//   (W) CommandRing<T, N>    — main posts POD commands; the writer drains them
//       under the lock it already holds (main->model).
//
// SCOPE: one Ubiquitty::Terminal == one writer == one RuntimeLink. Carries only this
// pane's parser/frame state (geometry, modes, cursor, scrollback). Window LAYOUT
// (the pane tree) is a separate concern and is never published here.
//
// Safety by absence: there is no synchronous model->main primitive.
// A Core/OSC hook cannot reach a main-thread dispatch from this seam, so it cannot
// deadlock against a main thread blocked on the model lock.
