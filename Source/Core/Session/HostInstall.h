// How a bundled `ubiquitty-host` reaches a remote host and replaces the one
// there: the probe that asks the host what it is and how many sessions its
// running daemon holds, the install that verifies an upload before anything
// is replaced, and the reading of what each printed.
//
// The scripts run under the remote's /bin/sh, one ssh argument each, and use
// double quotes only so the caller can wrap them in single quotes. Nothing
// here builds from source: a platform no bundled binary serves is told how to
// install by hand (DeployPolicy.h), never compiled for.
//
// Sessions are counted rather than asked for. The daemon an update replaces
// is by definition a build this client cannot speak to, so the count comes
// from the process table: each live session is one shell the daemon forked,
// and the daemon's pid file names it under the socket leaf its binary hashes
// to (DaemonSocketLeaf.h).
