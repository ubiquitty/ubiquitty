// The portable remote-session state machine. Drives a Sync session over a

// into a passive Terminal → reconnect on a drop → stop. The platform supplies thin hooks (Dispatcher,
// ChannelFactory, RemoteSessionObserver).
//
// Single-threaded by contract: every public method and handler runs on the session
// thread. The Channel fires callbacks on its own I/O thread; the core marshals each
// onto the session thread via the Dispatcher, so the Terminal is only touched there.
