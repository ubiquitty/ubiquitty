// The control-only Sync client that answers what a host is running before
// anything attaches to it: typed host listing and termination calls for the
// directory and the exact row the person chose to end.
//
// One channel per errand and no reconnect machinery: HELLO, the one frame the
// errand is, the answer, then the channel is gone. Every errand's HELLO is
// followed by a Sync `Greet`, so the channel is a Sync connection that
// binds no pane (Docs/sync.md §6.1): it can call the host methods its role
// and scope admit, it answers the host's probes, and it says `Bye{Normal}` on
// the way out so the host holds no attachment for it.
//
// A listing asks for more than the flat rows: it subscribes to the host's
// listing on the same connection, is sent every workspace's structure and
// the facts and status of every pane, and assembles the host's tree from
// them (SessionTree.h). A refresh delivers the tree once, whole, beside the
// rows, and closes. A watch keeps the channel and delivers the tree again
// whenever what it is built from changes, until it is stopped: it is the one
// errand that outlives its first answer. A person asked for it and is looking
// at what it keeps current, so it holds its connection through any silence of
// the host's, as an attached session does, and when its carrier drops it says
// so and dials again, a second apart at first and then backing off
// (ReconnectBackoff.h), until it is stopped or the host refuses it.
//
// A carrier that drops says so. A path that dies underneath one does not, so
// a watch asks: when its connection has been quiet for
// `watchProbeIntervalSeconds` it sends the screen plane's probe, and a
// connection that has not answered within `proofOfLifeDeadlineSeconds` is
// dropped and dialled again like one whose carrier went (ProofOfLife.h).
//
// No errand waits on a carrier to say it is dead. A dial that has brought no
// welcome within `directoryHandshakeSeconds` is one that failed, and a host
// that welcomed an errand answers it within `directoryAnswerSeconds`: a
// refresh its rows, a call its result, a management request its reply. Past
// either the errand fails as a host that could not be reached, in Core's
// words, and a watch dials again.
//
// Every errand's connection is serviced on a timer as well as on arrival:
// the host probes a connection it has nothing to say to, and drops one whose
// answer does not come within its silence bound. A connection that survived
// between errands would hold an attach the person did not ask for, and a
// directory that reconnects on its own polls a host nobody asked it to poll.
//
// Nothing here mirrors a grid, so the sync client is built with no Terminal and
// the screen a bound session sends is decoded and dropped.
//
// Single-threaded by contract, as RemoteSessionCore is: the Channel fires on its
// own I/O thread and every callback is marshaled onto the Dispatcher's thread,
// which is also the only thread the public methods may be called from.
