// LineStore — content-trimmed line storage for terminal scrollback.
//
// Replaces the flat full-width scrollback arena (capacity × maxColumns cells,
// paid in full at the row ceiling regardless of content) with a list of
// fixed-size cell slabs ("blocks", a block-list scrollback layout). Each retained
// line is copied once, TRIMMED to its content length, into the current
// block; a full block starts a new one; FIFO eviction frees a whole block
// once all the lines it backs have aged out. Typical content (most lines far
// short of full width) costs proportionally less; the pathological all-full-
// width case matches a full-width arena, never exceeds it.
//
// A fixed ring of `StoredLine` descriptors (capacity entries) gives O(1)
// index access (`at`); the blocks own the cells. Lines evict oldest-first,
// blocks fill front-to-back, so the oldest live line is always in the front
// block — eviction needs no per-line block bookkeeping. A blank line owns no
// cells and belongs to no block. The blocks partition the row ordinals all the
// same: a block's span runs from the ordinal of its first line to the next
// block's first, so a line's block is found by its ordinal, and the blank
// lines a span covers are never decoded.
//
// A block has two forms. A *raw* block is the slab of cells the append path
// writes, and a line in it is read at the cost of a pointer. A *folded* block
// holds the same lines as row forms (Core/Screen/RowForm.h): UTF-8 text plus
// run-length pens over a pen table of the block's own, so the pens die with
// the block and no id ever rolls. Folding is byte-exact — a line read from a
// folded block is the line that was appended — and it runs off the append
// path: `foldColdBlocks` is called from the ingest loop's quiet path, where
// nothing is being drained. A line in a folded block is read by decoding its
// whole block into a scratch slab that a small cache of recently decoded
// blocks owns, and the line's `cells` then point into it.
//
// Portable Core: STL is allowed here (not the PAL seam); no exceptions/rtti.

    //
    // - The reader, for each block, takes the gate's lock, publishes the
    //   block's sequence as its hazard, then checks that the block is not
    //   released (`oldestLiveSequence`) and that no other mutation happened
    //   since its snapshot (`invalidation`). It reads, clears the hazard, frees
    //   anything eviction deferred to it, and unlocks.
    // - Eviction, the one mutation that runs at full speed beside a reader,
    //   publishes the released block's end as `oldestLiveSequence`, then reads
    //   the hazard. Both are sequentially consistent, so either the reader sees
    //   the block released and skips it, or eviction sees the hazard and hands
    //   the block's memory to the reader to free instead of parking it.

    //   `invalidation` and takes the gate's lock once, which waits for at most
    //   one block read, with the waiter's priority donated to the reader.
