// The one visible-grid → flat text projection. Named for its first consumer; every
// screen-read in the product must produce the same characters.
//
// Consumers: macOS VoiceOver (TerminalSurface+Accessibility.swift, needs the UTF-16 ranges),
// Linux AT-SPI (Accessibility.cpp), agent/MCP (AgentSession::screenText),
// and the control socket's get-text (ControlHost.swift).
//
// The rule — visible-cell walk, wide-cell and combining-mark handling,
// trailing-space trim, row join, UTF-16 range accounting — is defined here and
// nowhere else.
