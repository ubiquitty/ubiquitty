// The largest 2D texture edge a Metal GPU family allows.
//
// Metal states this per family rather than exposing a query, so the device has
// to be asked which family it is in, and that question is asked in Swift
// (UbiquittyRenderKit/MTLDevice+Capabilities.swift). The NUMBERS live here,
// beside Core's atlas clamp that takes them as a parameter: a backend carrying
// its own 16384 keeps working until it runs somewhere the answer is 8192, and
// the failure is a texture that silently fails to create rather than anything
// naming a limit.
//
// The family mapping imports no framework and is exposed through the module
// map both Apple arms read.
