// Bringing this machine's host up to the build an app bundles, by handover.
//
// A running host hands its sessions only to a successor whose executable is
// the file at the path the holder was installed at (Docs/sync.md §6.13). A
// host is installed at one of two paths: the app bundle's helper, where an
// app starts it, and the control directory's `ubiquitty-host`, where an SSH
// bootstrap installs and starts it. The app keeps starting its bundled
// helper, whose host trusts the app beside it, and makes the control
// directory's install that very file, so a holder installed at either path
// admits the successor the app starts. A host started from the install trusts
// the same app through the name the install leaves beside it
// (`Host::interfacePathForHost`).
//
// Native file and socket work stays behind this seam; Core supplies the paths
// and the daemon start, and words what is left undone from the facts here
// (`Session::LocalHostUpgradeFacts`).
