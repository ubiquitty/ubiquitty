// Which binaries a host takes for its own: the successor it hands its
// sessions to, and the app and relay it treats as its person's.
//
// A host on macOS judges a binary by the code signature of what it runs. A
// release build trusts the release team's Developer ID signature and nothing
// else, so an unsigned or ad hoc binary is never its successor nor its app,
// wherever it lies. A development build, which runs unsigned or under a
// development certificate, also trusts the file at the path it was installed
// at and the files its app names. A platform that signs no code, Linux, trusts
// by the file alone
// (Docs/sync.md §6.13, Docs/capability-origin.md).
//
// The policy here is portable and pure; the platform reads the signatures
// (`CodeSignature.h`).
