"""build_root — where a checkout's build output goes.

Outside the checkout. A build tree inside a worktree makes `git status` slow,
makes every `rm -rf` of a worktree a decision about gigabytes, and leaves the
artefacts behind when the worktree is removed, or when its repository loses
track of it.

The layout is Xcode's, for the same reason Xcode uses it: a name a person can
read, and a hash that says which checkout it belongs to.

    ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Ubiquitty-<Xcode's 28-letter path hash>

Xcode's own directory, so that Xcode's "Delete Derived Data" and the Storage
pane in System Settings clear these too -- a build tree somewhere of our own
invention is one more thing a person has to know about to reclaim. Xcode names
its own <Name>-<28 lowercase letters>; a hex digest cannot collide with that and
says at a glance which entries are ours.

On non-macOS hosts the parent is $XDG_CACHE_HOME/ubiquitty/build, defaulting
to ~/.cache/ubiquitty/build. Relative XDG_CACHE_HOME values are ignored.

UBIQUITTY_DERIVED_DATA moves the whole tree; UBQ_BUILD_ROOT names one build root
outright and skips the derivation, which is what a CI job with its own workspace
wants.

Scripts/build-root.sh derives the identical path for shell callers, and
Scripts/check-build-root.py holds the two to agreeing — a python gate
fingerprinting one directory while the shell builds into another would report a
verdict about bytes nobody wrote.
