"""A backend that leaves a lossy entry null has to say which one, and where.

`GlyphBackend`'s optional entries mostly degrade fairly — a procedural area fill
beats the font's, an unligatured row is still correct text. Four do not, and
`optionalDefaultsAreLossy` names them: without `clusterGlyph` a combining mark is
dropped, without `wideClusterGlyph` the same happens on a two-cell base, without
`colorGlyph` an emoji loses its colour, and without `boxGlyph` a box-drawing line
loses the font's weight and dashes. All four leave the cell inked and the count
right, so every check downstream passes and only the picture is wrong.

The frontend is the one that decides, and Core cannot decide for it. What Core
cannot do either is notice when a frontend's prose and its table disagree: a
comment claiming a complete backend costs nothing to write and nothing to keep
true. One such claim survived a `wideClusterGlyph` landing and read as accurate
until someone ran the parity check.

So the rule is not "fill every entry" — that would be false for backends with no
colour sheet and no shaper. It is that an omission is **stated**: a lossy entry
a construction site leaves null must be named in a comment in the same file. A
reader then meets the omission where the table is built, and a frontend that
grows a new lossy entry cannot acquire it silently.

What this cannot see, demonstrated rather than supposed. It compares a copy of
the lossy set against `optionalDefaultsAreLossy` and reports which backends fill
those entries. Both the copy and the predicate say a thing is lossy; neither can
say whether the predicate is COMPLETE.

An entry can be lossy for only part of its range, which is where a comment goes
wrong. `BoxDrawing::prefersProcedural` splits `boxGlyph`'s: for blocks, shades
and the diagonals the entry is never consulted and a null costs nothing, but for
box-drawing lines 2500..257F the builder reaches for it FIRST — so a null there
drops the font's weight and dashes, which is the predicate's own test for a
loss. A comment that judged the entry by the first half and called it lossless
to omit would keep it out of the predicate, and every stream and encode parity
lane would still agree, because each arm agrees with its own table; a
dense-sampled pixel comparison is what finds U+2551 as an antialiased 8px font
raster on one arm and two crisp 3px procedural strokes on the other.

So the limit is precise: this gate catches an entry nobody classified, and
cannot catch one classified WRONGLY. A claim true of the common case,
generalised in a comment, then relied on by a check, is the shape it is blind
to — and reading the predicate is exactly how it inherits the comment.

    ./Scripts/check-glyph-backend-claims.py

Prints the matrix every run, because the interesting output is which backend
supplies what, and exits 1 naming any omission no comment mentions. Stdlib only.
