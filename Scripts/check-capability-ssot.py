"""check-capability-ssot.py — the capability vocabulary has one source of truth.

Three checks, all keyed on the enum itself rather than on a hand-written list:

  1. no drifting parallel allow-list — a switch keyed on Capability outside the
     two files sanctioned to hold one
  2. coverage — every capability is gated through check()/respond(), or named in
     UNGATED_ALLOWLIST with a reason
  3. tierOf() totality — every enumerator has an explicit case rather than
     riding the fail-closed default

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = violations, 2 = the enum could not be parsed.

#                 pull-state here — this lint will flag it the moment it is wired
#                 without one only if it is REMOVED from this list, so a handler

# named below that acquires any reference outside the enum's own header fails
# the gate: the entry is not wrong, it has expired, and what it excused now

# Empty: every entry above states a reason that does not depend on nothing
# referencing it. A capability named here is excused only while no handler
# emits it, so the claim is re-derived on every run and expires the moment one
