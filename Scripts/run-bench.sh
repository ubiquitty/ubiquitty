#
#   ./Scripts/run-bench.sh [out.json]
#
# Compiles Tests/Performance/bench_stack.cpp against the portable Core (release, -O2)
# and runs it, stamping the platform + commit. Each CI runner (Linux, macOS, …)
# produces the same JSON shape, so runs key by commit for the trend and the
# regression comparison. Portable: no GUI, no platform frontend.
#
# READING A DELTA. Lanes here do not share a noise floor, and judging one
# against another's is how a good run gets discarded and a bad one believed.
# parse_plain is the noisier: it is the throughput lane, and it never
# accumulates a parameter, which makes it the control for anything touching
# parameter parsing rather than a second signal. parse_sgr drives the CSI
# parameter accumulate.
#
# The spread is a property of the method, not the lane. Interleaving the arms
# and taking best-of-2 suppresses drift that sequential rounds absorb into one
# arm. So quote a spread with the method that produced it; a threshold carried
# across methods rejects real results.
#
# A control that moves while the target does not is load landing unevenly across
# the run rather than an effect. Discard it and re-run on a quiet box; do not
# reason about the size of the move.
