"""Refuse a kept translation unit that needs a symbol only a trimmed one defines.

Each frontend takes a subset of portable Core through `ubiquitty_core_subset(…
EXCLUDE …)`, dropping the translation units that shell does not use. Nothing
checks the other side of that cut: a Core commit can add a call from a kept file
into a trimmed one, and the only report is an undefined symbol for whoever builds
that arm next: a function defined in a source two subsets trim and called from a
source both keep leaves main unlinkable on that arm.

`check-core-srcs-complete.py` enforces exactly this partition for the test
harness; this is its equivalent for the frontend subsets.

## Latent, not always live — and the difference is the linker

A reference that survives is not a reference that is safe. A kept source can
call readers in a source the agent trims and the agent still links: ld64
discards code no entry point reaches, so the undefined references go with it.
The same pair on a linker that does not strip is the break above. So this
refuses the reference itself, not the subset of references that happen to be
fatal on one linker.

## Why symbols rather than includes or grep

The question is which definitions a link needs, and only the object files answer
it. The host test build compiles every canonical Core translation unit, so one
`nm` pass over that build gives both halves — what each file defines and what
each references — without configuring a single frontend. That matters for Wscons
in particular, which no Linux or macOS machine can configure at all.

Three bounds:

    a kept TU referencing a trimmed-only symbol -> FAIL, the cut is broken
    a subset naming a file not in the canonical
    source list                                 -> FAIL, a stale name
    no objects, or no subsets parsed            -> REFUSE, an empty scan and a
                                                   clean tree print alike
    --self-test with no object tree at all      -> SKIPPED, naming the build
                                                   that supplies one
    --if-built with no object tree at all       -> SKIPPED, for check-style on
                                                   a machine that builds nothing

What this cannot see, stated so nobody quotes it for more: the symbol tables are
the host build's. A definition or reference that exists only under another
platform's conditional compilation is invisible here, and so is anything a
frontend's own Platform sources define.
