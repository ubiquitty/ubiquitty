# check-source-file-names — every tracked file under Source/ carries an
# extension the build can see.
#
# Every other gate here keys on extensions: the boundary checks glob *.h and
# *.cpp, the build registers named suffixes, the content-loss check counts what
# it can classify. A file with no extension is invisible to all of them at
# once: a duplicate of a protocol source committed by an add sweep under an
# extensionless name passes every gate in the chain, referenced by nothing and
# flagged by nothing. The name is the one fact every gate shares; this checks
# it.
