# check-workflows.sh — lint .github/workflows/*.yml with a pinned actionlint.
#
# A workflow file that YAML accepts and GitHub rejects reaches main as a run
# with zero jobs and the message "This run likely failed because of a workflow
# file issue". No YAML parser sees it: the rule that breaks the file is
# GitHub's expression-context rule (a job's env: cannot read `runner`, which
# exists only once a runner does), not YAML's. actionlint checks expression
# contexts, action inputs against the pinned action's schema, and the shape of
# each run: step.
#
#   Scripts/check-workflows.sh              # lint every workflow file
#   Scripts/check-workflows.sh --self-test  # the rules against a planted file
#
# The binary is pinned by version and by the sha256 of its release archive,
# as the workflows pin their actions by commit. Resolution order:
#   1. $UBQ_ACTIONLINT — an explicit path, for a machine that keeps its own.
#      A path that is not executable is a fault, not a stand-down: an operator
#      who named one asked for that binary.
#   2. $UBQ_BUILD_ROOT/tools/actionlint-<version>/actionlint — the copy an
#      earlier run of this script downloaded and verified.
#   3. A download of the pinned release into that cache, verified before it
#      runs. The CI image carries the same version under /usr/local/bin, so a
#      battery inside it takes the first branch and fetches nothing.
# A copy found on PATH is not consulted: an unpinned version applies a
# different rule set than the one the tree was checked against.
#
# A machine that has no copy and cannot fetch one stands down, the way every
# gate here stands down for a tool it does not have — the absence is a fact
# about the machine, not about the tree. CI carries the binary in its image,
# so the lint runs there whatever a developer's machine has.
#
# The shellcheck and pyflakes integrations are off. actionlint runs them only
# where the binaries happen to be installed, so with them on the verdict
# would depend on the machine rather than on the tree.
#
# Two rules are ignored, and the reason for each lives here rather than in a
# configuration file the gate could drift from:
#   - `runner.workspace` is a real context property the workflows rely on for
#     their cache paths; actionlint's schema of the runner context omits it.
#   - `if: ${{ false }}` is how a job is parked with its wiring intact; the
#     rule's advice is to delete the condition, which would run the job.
# Both are spelled narrowly, and --self-test proves it: a different missing
# property and a different constant condition are still reported.
