# gen-portable-core-sources.sh - regenerate / verify the canonical
# libUbiquittyCore source list (Scripts/portable-core-sources.txt).
#
# The list is the single source of truth for the portable Core translation
# units, consumed by the CMake `ubiquitty-core` target and the bash perf
# drivers. This script derives it mechanically by globbing the portable
# modules (minus the external-dep QUIC carriers), so a file split can never
# silently drift hand-maintained copies again.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/gen-portable-core-sources.sh            # check: fail if stale
#   Scripts/gen-portable-core-sources.sh --write    # rewrite the list in place
#   Scripts/gen-portable-core-sources.sh --print    # print the derived list
#
# Exit 0 = list is current (or written), 1 = stale (check mode), 2 = usage.

HEADER='# Scripts/portable-core-sources.txt - THE canonical libUbiquittyCore source set.
#
# Single source of truth for the portable Core translation units, read by both
# the CMake `ubiquitty-core` static-library target and the bash perf/test
# drivers (run-bench.sh / run-profile.sh) so the link list can never drift
# (the hand-maintained-list breakage this file prevents). Regenerate after a
# file split with: Scripts/gen-portable-core-sources.sh --write
#
# Contents: every .cpp under the portable modules (Core, Codec, Unicode, Image,
# Rendering, Runtime, Protocol/{Sync,Tmux}, Preferences, Themes, Selection, Input,
# Session, Terminfo, Preferences, Diagnostics, Network, Transport) PLUS the PAL
# contract (PAL/PAL.cpp, PAL/TaskQueue.cpp) and the bundled POSIX PAL
# backend (Platform/POSIX/SystemPAL.cpp). EXCLUDES the QUIC carriers
# (Platform/POSIX/QUICClient.cpp, Transport/QUICChannel.cpp) - they pull the external
# ngtcp2 + AWS-LC stack, so they are opt-in, not part of the dependency-free lib.
#
# Lines are repo-relative paths; blank lines and #-comments are ignored.
#
# Paths comprising the canonical set, NUL-rule: keep sorted (gen script enforces).
