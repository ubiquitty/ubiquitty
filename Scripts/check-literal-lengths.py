"""A hand-written length beside a literal has to be the literal's length.

`std::string_view("…", N)` states a count the compiler will not check against
the string it sits next to. Where the two disagree the test still passes, so the
disagreement survives: the scene the literal describes is not the scene the code
feeds, and every assertion downstream is about the shorter or longer one.

@ubiquitty-layers found eleven of these while converting the VT ingest seam to
take one value. Nine fed less than they read as and two fed one byte more,
reading the literal's terminating NUL into a parser. The worst was a pair
writing `EDIT-A` and `EDIT-B` to tell two rows apart, at a length that stopped
after `EDI` — the names discriminated and the bytes did not.

The count is decidable from the literal, which is what makes this a gate rather
than a convention. C's `\\x` escape consumes as many hex digits as follow it, so
the decoder below stops at the first non-hex character exactly as a compiler
does; `\\0` through `\\7` take up to three octal digits.

    ./Scripts/check-literal-lengths.py

Exits 1 naming every site where the two disagree, with both numbers. Stdlib
only.
