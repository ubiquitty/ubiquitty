"""Check that no build directory holds a cached default the tree has moved past.

A `set(X "v" CACHE ...)` guarded by `if(NOT DEFINED X)` writes its value once,
when the directory is first configured. Raising the default afterwards changes
nothing for any directory that already exists: CMake keeps what it has and says
nothing about it, forever.

That is invisible in the worst way, because the symptom is a compile error in a
header nobody edited. Raising CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET from 13.0 to 13.3 so
`std::print` could be used produced, in one hour, across four checkouts:

    'to_chars' is unavailable: introduced in macOS 13.3   in a libc++ header
    "Failed test dependencies" on 17 ctest cases          from the build that failed
    a shell_snapshots STALENESS message                   the binary was old because
                                                          its build kept failing

Four checkouts, one cause, four symptoms, and not one of them named the cache. Two
of us ran source-level attribution controls — rebuild clean origin/main, see the
same failure, conclude the source is not the difference — which is a correct
experiment that cannot reach this answer: both arms use the same build
directory, so holding it fixed is holding the cause fixed.

This compares what a fresh configure would choose against what each existing
directory holds, and names the variable and the directory rather than whatever
the compiler happened to complain about.

Stdlib only.
