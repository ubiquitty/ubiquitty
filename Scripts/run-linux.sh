# run-linux.sh — run a repo command on Linux from macOS, natively.
#
# The Linux frontend needs GTK 4 and Vulkan development files, which do not
# exist on macOS, so the Linux build and its tests are unrunnable here without a
# machine. This gives one: an arm64 Ubuntu container with the prerequisites
# Scripts/check-linux-build-prerequisites.sh names, the working tree bind-mounted
# rather than copied, and the compiler cache kept on the host.
#
# arm64, because on Apple silicon an x86_64 image runs under emulation and
# a full build takes long enough that nobody runs it twice. Native is the whole
# point.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/run-linux.sh                    build the GTK frontend
#   Scripts/run-linux.sh test               run the host test suite on Linux
#   Scripts/run-linux.sh shell              interactive shell in the container
#   Scripts/run-linux.sh <command…>         run any command in the repo root
#
# The build directory and the compiler cache live under build/, which is
# gitignored, and are written as the invoking user rather than as root — a
# root-owned object file inside the tree is worse than a slow build.

# The image is built from a here-doc rather than a tracked Dockerfile so the
# prerequisite list lives in exactly one place: this script, beside the check
# that names the same packages.
#
# golang-go and perl are AWS-LC's, not ours. `run-linux.sh test` builds the QUIC
# host, whose CMake fetches AWS-LC, whose own build wants both — without them it
# stops at "Could not find Go" during configure, and every stanza that links the
# host reports BUILD-BROKEN for a reason that names none of this.
# The release is pinned for its compiler, not for its age: `<print>` and the rest
# of the C++23 library arrived in libstdc++ 14, and 24.04 carries 13.3 with no 14
# in its archive. 26.04 makes GCC 15 the default `g++`, so the Linux arm compiles
# the same standard the macOS and Web arms already do. A portable Core file is
# written once and built by all three; the oldest of them decides what the other
# two are allowed to use.
#
# An LTS rather than the interim release that first carried GCC 15: an interim
# leaves the archive after nine months, and a container recipe whose packages
# have moved to old-releases fails at `apt-get update` on a machine that never
# cached the image — which is every machine except the one that built it.

# The container gets its own build/ and the host keeps its own, because a CMake

# only way it can — `rm -rf` and reconfigure. Correct inside one environment,
# destructive across the mount: measured, a single Linux stanza deleted a
# complete macOS build, and the host's next run would delete these in return.
#
# Shadowing /src/build costs nothing on either side. Neither environment's
