"""Check that every gate in Scripts is invoked by something.

A gate that no aggregate, hook or workflow calls runs when a person types it and
at no other time. It is the quietest failure in the set: a gate that stands down
for a missing tool at least prints SKIPPED, and a gate that never ran leaves
nothing in any log to notice. An uninvoked gate is easy to quote as evidence.

A script nothing invokes is either a gate to wire or a tool — a person runs
`check-merge-ready.sh` before a merge and there is no push at which it belongs
— and the tools are named below with what invokes them instead.

The bound in the other direction: a script named here as a tool that something
has since started calling fails, because the entry then describes an arrangement
that ended, and a list things get filed into is where they stop being read.

What this cannot see, stated rather than implied: whether the invocation is
reached. `check-tidy` is called from `check-style` and stands down in CI for a
missing compile database; `check-shell` is called and stands down where CI has
no shellcheck. Being
invoked is the floor, not the ceiling — the terms above it are which tool is
installed where it runs, and whether anything reads what it prints.

One more term, because it fails in the same silence: whether a gate that runs can
still fail. A rule that has stopped matching prints the same clean line as a tree
with nothing to report, so being invoked and being useful are separate facts.
`Scripts/run-gate-self-tests.py` holds that one for every gate carrying a
self-test, and reports how many it found. Most gates carry none and have no
answer to it — a gap this file cannot close and should not be read as covering.

Stdlib only.

    Two forms are a call. A path reaches the gate through its directory —
    `./Scripts/check-acronyms.py`, `"$ROOT/Scripts/check-slop.py"`, or through `bash` —
    so the basename is preceded by a slash, quoted or not. A bare token outside any
    quote is a shell word: `check-glyph-atlas.sh` on its own line inside a `CHECKS=(...)`
    array that a loop invokes through a variable, where the literal basename appears
    only as the list element. A bare name INSIDE a quote is prose — a dict value naming a
    gate a design might extend, a sentence, a label. That last form is the one that
    let a gate whose only surviving reference was such a sentence report as wired
    after its real call was deleted. Every occurrence on a line is examined, so a
