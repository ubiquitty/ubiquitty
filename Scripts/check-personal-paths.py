"""Scripts/check-personal-paths.py — public-tree privacy lint.

BLOCKS on machine-specific personal identifiers that must not ship in a public
tree.

The rule matches a SHAPE and then subtracts the values that are permitted. It
names no person, which is the whole design: a rule carrying one person's
username, hostname and account as literals blocks exactly one identity — and CI
runs as 'runner' and knows nobody else — so any other contributor's home path
passes the release gate. Matching the shape protects
everyone identically and survives the maintainer, the contributors and the CI
account all changing.

Two patterns rather than one, because one pattern excluding the permitted values
needs a negative lookahead, and a lookahead in an ERE does not error — it changes
the meaning and the rule stops matching, silently.

  DETECT   the shape of a home path, an address, a personal machine name
  ALLOW    the values that are synthetic, published, or a third party's own

Anything DETECT finds and ALLOW does not cover is a violation. An ALLOW entry is
therefore a claim that a value is already public, so this list holds nothing that
needs protecting.

The DERIVED half stays: the current user (id -un) and short hostname
(hostname -s), which catch an identity whose shape says nothing — a username that
looks like any other word.

Test fixtures use neutral synthetic values (/Users/user, /home/user, user@host);
the public remote is github.com/ubiquitty/ubiquitty.

Derived-half inputs (defaults: id -un, hostname -s):
  --user <name> / --host <name>       explicit override, before other args
  UBIQUITTY_LINT_USER / UBIQUITTY_LINT_HOST   environment equivalents

EXEMPT (not scanned):
  - Source/ThirdParty/               vendored upstream code
  - Tests/Core/fuzz-corpus/          opaque fuzz inputs (binary; scrubbed separately)
  - binary fixtures (png/ttf/…) and this script itself.
Published contact (yaglo@me.com in CODE_OF_CONDUCT/SECURITY/author headers)
matches no pattern here and is preserved.

Usage:
  Scripts/check-personal-paths.py            # all tracked files
  Scripts/check-personal-paths.py --staged   # staged files only (pre-commit)
  Scripts/check-personal-paths.py file ...   # specific files
  Scripts/check-personal-paths.py --self-test # attribution scope controls

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = personal-identifier violations, 2 = usage error.

Wired into Scripts/hooks/pre-commit (BLOCKS) and Scripts/check-style.py.

The detect pattern runs once over each whole file rather than once per line:
almost no file carries a hit, so a clean file costs the regex engine one entry.
