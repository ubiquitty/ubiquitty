"""check-doc-references.py — a reference doc names code that exists.

Two rules, because a doc reference rots in two different ways and only one of
them is visible.

**No line numbers.** A citation such as `VT.cpp:5821` is right the day it is
typed and drifts with every edit above it: it lands mid-function, on a bare
closing brace, or past the end of a file that has shrunk. Arithmetic catches
the last and nothing catches the rest, which is the problem with the form
rather than with the people maintaining it. A file plus a symbol is greppable
and survives every edit above it, so that is what the rule requires.

Three spellings are read: `VT.cpp:885`, `NativeAttachment.h,203`, and
`(line 877)` in prose. A rule keyed on one spelling of a form vouches for every
doc written in another, so the count it reports is about the spelling, not the
tree.

**A named symbol exists.** A rename sweep that reaches the code and the
conventions doc can miss a doc that names the symbol under its own section
heading — `emitChar` renamed to `emitCharacter` by the `Char -> Character`
ratchet in coding-conventions.md — and a reader grepping for the old name then
finds documents describing it and no code.

The second rule is scoped and the first is not. A design doc proposes names that
do not exist yet, which is its purpose; `Docs/naming-conventions.md` names
`fooCount` and `maxXxx` as illustrations. Failing either would be reporting a doc
for doing what it is for. So symbols are checked only in docs whose subject is
the tree as it stands, listed in DESCRIBES_THE_TREE below. Line numbers rot the
same way in every doc, so that rule covers all of them.

Adding a doc to DESCRIBES_THE_TREE is how the second rule grows. A list rather
than a heuristic, because "description or proposal" is a judgement about intent:
a heuristic that guesses wrong either lets rot through or reports a design doc
for proposing a name.

**Code comments navigate by name too.** A comment that sends its reader to
`CellInstanceBuilder.cpp:878` rots exactly as a doc does, and a file several
thousand lines long moves under it with every edit. So the line-number rule
reads the comments of every tracked source file as well, through check-slop.py's
`prose`, which keeps a file's comments and docstrings and blanks its code and
string literals: a fixture that feeds a gate `Source/Core/Foo.cpp:42` as data is
not a comment. One spelling is a format rather than a reference:
`Source/Core/Foo.cpp:42:` with a colon after the number is how a compiler or a
gate prints a finding, and a comment documenting that output names no line of
any file. This file is left out, because its own prose spells the forms it
rejects.

A gate's record is source too: a `.txt` list under Scripts/ or Tests/ whose
`#` comments give the reason for each entry, as Tests/unwired-flags.txt and
the snapshot exemption lists do. Its comments cite code as any comment does
and rot the same way, so they are read too, and a citation may name a `.txt`
or `.cmake` file, `CMakeLists.txt:22` among them. Fixtures, corpora and
goldens under those directories are data and are not read.

The bare continuation references in `Docs/emacs-terminal-spec.md` — `(:1746)`,
`(:231-245)`, about fifteen of them — inherit whichever file an earlier sentence
named, and this gate does not match them. They rot faster than a full citation,
since a reader cannot tell which file is meant without scanning back. Matching
one needs the doc's running file context, and rewriting one needs to know which
site the author meant; both belong to whoever owns that spec.

Stdlib only.
