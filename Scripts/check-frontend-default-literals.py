"""check-frontend-default-literals — a frontend must not spell a default Core owns.

`c.ligatures.value_or(true)` in a frontend is a second spelling of
`Defaults::ligatures`, and the two agree only until somebody changes the
default. An `ambiguous_width` written `value_or(1)` by one arm and
`value_or(Defaults::ambiguousWidth)` by another is a width the two arms can
disagree about, and that places every later cell on the row differently.

The rule is narrow on purpose. It fires only where every one of these holds:

  - the file is under Source/Platform, so it is a frontend rather than Core;
  - the field names an `Effective::` accessor, so there is somewhere to route
    to and the routing is a one-line change;
  - the argument is a literal rather than `Defaults::x` or another call, so
    the site is restating a value rather than reading one;
  - the same optional does not guard the call, which would make the argument
    unreachable.

Three shapes read like the defect and are correct. Each has a case in the
selftest below rather than only a sentence here:

  a guarded deref — `if (s.fontSize) f = s.fontSize.value_or(0.0);` — where the
  argument cannot be reached and `value_or` stands in for `*`;

  a frontend's own native default, where the value is not Core's because the
  frontend draws at a different unit: the browser draws at Unifont's 16px cell
  rather than Core's 12pt, and the portable snapshot sizes for its Unifont
  raster. Annotate those `// native-default: <why>`;

  a field with no accessor, which has nowhere to route and is a gap in Core
  rather than a defect in the frontend.
