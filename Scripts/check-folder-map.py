"""check-folder-map.py — every drawing of the source tree is the source tree.

The README's repository layout and ARCHITECTURE's layer map each draw `Source/`
as an indented tree, and a new reader takes their bearings from them. A drawing
nothing compares to the filesystem drifts in every way the tree moves: a
directory renamed under it keeps its old name in the drawing, a directory split
in two stays one, and modules drawn at their parent's indent are drawn beside
it, so someone looking for Source/Rendering/ finds nothing.

The rule is one-directional. A name the map draws must exist at the level it is
drawn; a directory the map leaves out is not reported. A drawing that leaves
out most Core submodules reads better for it. Demanding
completeness would turn every new directory into a documentation edit and produce
lines added to satisfy a gate. Naming something that is not there is the other
case: it sends a reader somewhere empty.

A drawing is a fenced block whose first line is `Source/` and nothing else, in
any Markdown file at the repository root or directly under Docs/; a block that
opens on a deeper path is a list of paths, not a tree. The gate finds drawings rather
than naming the files that hold them: a tree that does not carry some document
still has every drawing it does carry checked, and a drawing added later is
checked without an edit here. Finding none fails the gate, since nothing was
compared.

Indentation is the parent. An entry is a child of the nearest entry above it
with a smaller indent, which is how the drawings already read. Box-drawing
characters count as indentation, so a `├──` tree reads the same way as a plain
indented one.

Stdlib only.
