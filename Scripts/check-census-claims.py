"""check-census-claims.py — a count of the tree, written in prose, still holds.

A comment that counts something the tree contains is a claim with an expiry
nobody sets. `check-swift-module-compiles.sh` said "the eighteen files compile
together" and the module had reached thirty-nine; a reader who timed the gate
saw more than double the stated three seconds, and nothing in the comment said
whether the gate had grown or changed subject. The number was right when it
was written, which is the whole difficulty: nothing re-reads it, and the code it
describes moves underneath it.

Two counts are not this defect and are not asked about. A budget lives in code
and the gate holding it already fails in both directions, which is the shape a
number that decides something should have; this check exists to push the others
toward it. Small numbers are rhetoric: "a rule that fires on one file" counts nothing.
The threshold below is where a number stops reading as a turn of phrase and
starts reading as a census.

A claim can be settled three ways, and the gate wants one of them:

  DERIVED    `eighteen files [= Source/UbiquittyRenderKit/*.swift]`
             The pathspec is re-globbed here and the count must match. This is
             the only form that cannot rot, because the tree answers it.

  HISTORICAL `the module was eighteen files when this was written`
             Explicitly past. A reader knows not to trust it as current, which
             is all a historical number has to do.

  DATED      `measured 2026-08-03: 260 cases in 4.5s`
             A timing is not re-derivable from the tree at all, so the date is
             what makes it readable — it says how old the evidence is.

Anything else is an undated census, and those are counted against a budget that
may only fall.
