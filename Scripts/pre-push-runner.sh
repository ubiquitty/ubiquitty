# The gate runner Scripts/pre-push-gates.sh drives: each gate's verdict, the line
# it leaves on the terminal, and the cached pass behind a verdict that was one.
# Sourced after Scripts/pre-push-cache.sh, whose ubq_gate_cache_* calls it makes.
#
# A verdict lands in exactly one of PASSED, SKIPPED and FAILED. CACHED names the
# passes served from the cache, WARNED the passes whose gate printed a warning,
# and FAILED_LOG holds each failure's log path at the failure's index.

#   run_scoped <name> <scope> <command...>
#
# <scope> is a space-separated list of git pathspecs. Everything the gate reads
# from the repository must be inside it, and Scripts/check-gate-scopes.py holds
# the declaration to that: a gate reaching an input its scope omits fails there
# rather than becoming a stale pass here.
#
# Without a declaration the only sound key is the whole tree, which makes every
# gate depend on every file, so a markdown edit reruns the emscripten link and
# the snapshot renders. The declaration is what lets the key be narrower.
