"""check-boundaries.py — the module boundaries the tree is built on.

Each rule names a direction code must not flow: Core must not reach
for a frontend, a portable module must not import an Apple framework or touch
raw POSIX, a platform seam must not name a Core model type, a frontend must not
redeclare a Core enum.

  Scripts/check-boundaries.py
  Scripts/check-boundaries.py --self-test

Exit 0 = every boundary holds, 1 = at least one does not.

Every root a rule searches is checked to exist before any rule runs. A grep over
a directory that moved produces no output, which is exactly what no violation
produces — so a renamed module turns its rule off and the section still prints
ok, passing without reading a file.

The corpus is read once and every rule asked of it, rather than a recursive grep
per rule over the same trees.

Findings name a repository-relative path. A grep of "$ROOT/Source/..." prints
the checkout's own location on every line, which is not something a
reader or an editor can use; this is the same difference already taken in
check-compiler-launcher, and it is the shape gate_report.finding emits.
