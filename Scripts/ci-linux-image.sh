# ci-linux-image.sh — run a CI battery in the pinned Linux image on a
# GitHub-hosted runner, or directly on a self-hosted one.
#
#   Scripts/ci-linux-image.sh <command…>
#   Scripts/ci-linux-image.sh --recipe-digest    the digest the image is tagged by
#
# With UBQ_CI_LINUX_IMAGE=true, which ci.yml sets when the job landed on a
# GitHub-hosted runner, the command runs in the image. Anything else runs it
# here: a self-hosted runner carries its own toolchain.
#
# A hosted runner starts with no images, so without help every job builds this
# one before its first gate. UBQ_CI_IMAGE_ARCHIVE names a `docker save` archive
# that ci.yml restores from the Actions cache, keyed by --recipe-digest: an
# absent image is loaded from it when it is there, and saved into it after a
# build, so the image is rebuilt only when the recipe changes.
#
# A hosted runner is GitHub's ubuntu-24.04 image. It has no llvm-profdata, no
# GTK 4 and no g++ 15, so a battery run on it tests whatever GitHub installed.
# The image is run-linux.sh's instead: the gtk= base pinned in
# Scripts/linux-images.txt and the package list printed by
# `run-linux.sh dockerfile`. On top of that come the tools a battery otherwise
# installs through sudo: clang for the fuzz and sanitizer stages, make,
# python3-venv for the pinned clang-format, and the shellcheck binary. file
# comes for appimagetool, which stops without it when packaging the
# AppImage in this image.
#
# The image's clang is LLVM 21, which refuses the format version of the Linux
# training profile: Support/pgo/linux-x86_64-core.profdata is written by LLVM
# 22. So clang-22 and llvm-22 come too, and UBQ_PGO_LLVM names their directory
# of unversioned tools, which the Linux pgo stage and the release AppImage put
# first on PATH. A retrain under a newer LLVM major raises the two packages and
# UBQ_PGO_LLVM with it; the pgo stage fails until they name that LLVM.
#
# Every runner path is mounted at the same path, not under /src. The musl host
# build runs `docker run -v "$ROOT":/src` against the runner's daemon, which
# resolves that path on the runner, so ROOT has to be the same string on both
# sides. The checkout is also mounted at /src, because the recipe registers the
# shipped fonts from /src/Resources/fonts.
