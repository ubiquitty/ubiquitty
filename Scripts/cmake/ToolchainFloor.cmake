# ToolchainFloor.cmake — what this tree asks of a compiler, answered at configure
# time: the oldest versions it builds with, and whether the compiler can read the
# checked-in training profile.
#
# Source/Base/ToolchainFloor.h asserts what portable Core needs from a compiler,
# as the standard's own macros. It fires on the first translation unit that
# reaches it, which is the whole build later and once per file. The floor here
# states the same requirement as the compiler versions that meet it, before
# anything is compiled, and names what to install instead.
#
#   GNU 14    The first GCC that reports 202302L for -std=c++23 and parses
#             deducing this (Base/WeakPtr.h). GCC 13, what Ubuntu 24.04's `g++`
#             installs, stamps 202100L and rejects the explicit object parameter.
#   Clang 19  The first clang whose concepts support clears libstdc++'s gate for
#             std::expected (`__cpp_concepts` 202002L). Clang 18, what Ubuntu
#             24.04's `clang` installs, reports 201907L and finds <expected>
#             empty against libstdc++. Over libc++ it would have the template,
#             and it is refused anyway: the standard library is chosen by flags
#             this check cannot see, so the floor is stated per compiler.
#
# AppleClang is not version-checked here. Apple numbers its clang independently
# of LLVM, so no LLVM floor translates to it. README.md names the Apple clang
# the macOS app needs, and the header above still refuses a toolchain that lacks
# C++23 or std::expected. Emscripten reports as Clang and carries its own LLVM,
# so the Clang floor applies to it as written.

# Answers whether the C++ compiler reads an LLVM profile under -fprofile-use.
#
# Being clang is necessary and not sufficient. An indexed profile carries the
# format version of the llvm-profdata that wrote it, and a clang older than that
# refuses the file with "unsupported instrumentation profile format version" on
# every translation unit it compiles. So the compiler is asked directly, by
# compiling one empty translation unit with the flag, rather than its version
# being compared against a table of which LLVM wrote which format. The compile
# is never linked or run, which keeps the probe valid for a cross build.
#
# The answer is cached under `cacheKey`, which the caller derives from the
# profile's content: a retrained profile is asked about again, and an unchanged
# one costs a single compile per build directory.
#
# - Parameters:
#   - resultVariable: set to TRUE when the compiler read the profile, FALSE
#     otherwise.
#   - reasonVariable: set to the compiler's own complaint when it did not, or
#     to an empty string.
#   - profile: path to the `.profdata`.
#   - cacheKey: a string that changes whenever the profile's content does.
