"""check-backlog-growth.py — did this branch make a tolerated backlog worse?

`check-interface-docs.py` and `check-enums.sh` block a newly added violation and
tolerate the rest, so the backlog has no number and cannot be shown to be
measured correctly. The fix for that is a lower bound: a count that must not
silently shrink either, because a budget above the truth is a gate that has
never once been able to fail.

Recording the number in a file is the wrong way to get one. Several checkouts
push to this repository. A count recorded by one of them goes stale the moment another
lands anything, and the check then fails for everybody until somebody commits an
update — which is itself a push, racing the next checkout's. The tree is not at
fault when that blocks a push: the number is.

So the reference is COMPUTED, in a throwaway worktree, at the MERGE BASE of HEAD
and `origin/main` — the commit this branch forked from, not wherever main has
reached since. There is no shared file to race on, nothing to keep current, and
the question asked is the one meant: not "does this match what someone wrote
down" but "did this branch make it worse". A stale reference is impossible by
construction, which is what the lower bound protects against.

The merge base is what makes that question answerable rather than merely asked.
Against main's tip the count also carries everything main did in the meantime
with its sign flipped, so a branch that has added nothing reports additions in
proportion to how far behind it is — and the further behind, the more confident
and more wrong the number.

A real worktree, not `git checkout <ref> -- .`: that restores file CONTENTS while
`git ls-files` still reads the INDEX, so the gates would enumerate this branch's
file list and read the reference's text. The counts come back equal for the
wrong reason.
