"""Refuse a snapshot profile naming a face nobody ships, or one nobody reads.

A case's [font] family is handed to the renderer by name. A name Core ships
resolves to a file in Resources/fonts and every arm rasterises the same face; a
name it does not ship falls through to the platform's font matcher, and then
what gets drawn is whatever that box happens to have. Two boxes substitute
differently — `Monaspace Neon NF` resolves to the variable Noto Sans from
/usr/share/fonts on a self-hosted Linux runner and to this tree's static NotoSans-Regular.ttf
in a developer's container — so the goldens record one box's substitution and
the other box reads a regression that is not there. That costs the typography
cases on the Linux arm, and their goldens on every tier record a face nobody
chose.

The second bound is the reader. A case carries its own settings in `cases.json`
and the harness materialises the TOML it renders with, so a file under
`Tests/Snapshots/configs` reaches a renderer only where a script names its path
or a case names it through `native`. A profile nothing names draws nothing: it
is validated here, carried by every checkout, and edited by whoever mistakes it
for the settings a case uses. The reader is what makes a profile a contract, so
a profile without one is refused.

One kind of unshipped family is admitted: a face the platform itself carries,
named by a profile whose every case is held on that platform's text stack alone
through `native_stacks`. SF Pro is on every macOS box and cannot be shipped, so
a case about its width axis is compared where it resolves and nowhere else; the
same profile under a case that also runs on another stack is refused, because
there the name falls through to that stack's matcher. The stack is not the
whole answer: the iOS simulator shares CoreText and does not resolve SF Pro by
name, so such a case is exempted there in `exempt-ios.txt`, with what the arm
drew instead.

The check is static: the families Core's bundled table names, plus the ones it
rasterises itself, against every family a snapshot profile names; and the
tracked tree against every profile the configs directory holds. It needs no
fonts installed and no rendering, so it runs in the style job — before a golden
is minted rather than after a tier disagrees.
