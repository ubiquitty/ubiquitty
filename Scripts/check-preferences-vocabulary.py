"""One concept, one word: the store Core reads is Preferences and nothing else.

Three vocabularies for one thing -- `Config` in a namespace, `Settings` in a key
table, `Preferences` at the PAL seam -- split along who wrote the file rather
than along any distinction a reader can use. `SettingsSchema` as Core data and
`SettingsRow` as macOS UI would share a word; `Config` as Core data and
`Preferences` as the seam would not.

One word is worth nothing without something that holds it. A word costs
nothing to reintroduce, reads correct in the file it lands in, and is invisible
until the tree has three names again -- so this refuses the two retired words in
the code that carries the store, and says where the boundary is.

What is not a violation, because each is the name of something else:

  - `config.toml`, its `[section]`s and its keys. The file belongs to the person
    editing it and its name is theirs. A rename that reached the TOML would
    break every configuration on disk.
  - The Sync wire. `MessageType::Config` gates a frame named CONFIG, and the
    enumerator follows the protocol rather than our vocabulary.
  - The macOS Settings window and every string a person reads. `SettingsView`
    names a window whose menu item says "Settings...", which is Apple's word for
    that window, not a second word for our store.
  - `configure`, `configuration`, `configured` as ordinary English about
    something other than the store.

So the rule is scoped to identifiers, in every tree that can name the store:
Source, Tests, Tools, Scripts and Docs.

# A sweep for either word is wrong, which is why this is a list.

# Sweeping for "Setting" catches real words: `FontFeatureSettings` and
# `FontVariationSettings` are OpenType's own spelling, `decrqssSettingReport` is
# a VT report, `LaunchSettings` is a bundle of resolved values rather than a name
# for the place they came from. The singular is not listed at all -- "Setting it
# mid-session is not an error" is a sentence, and the store was never called
# `Setting` -- while `SettingKey` and its siblings are listed by name.
#
# Sweeping for "Config" catches other people's configuration: wuffs answers a
# `wuffs_base__image_config`, TIFF has a PlanarConfiguration tag, and a SOCKS
# proxy has a `ProxyConfig`. None of those is this store, and demanding they be
# misspelled teaches a reader to bypass the gate rather than obey it.

# So the population is the names that named this store, and it can only shrink:
# an entry comes off when nothing spells it, never because a new file wants one.
