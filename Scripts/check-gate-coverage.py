"""A gate the commit runs is a gate the push runs, or it says why not.

Two hooks guard this tree. `pre-commit`
invokes its gates as a commit is made; `pre-push-gates.sh` invokes a larger set
before anything reaches origin. The sets overlap heavily, which reads as a
ladder — commit checks a little, push checks more — and is not one. They are two
parallel lists, and the difference between them is the set of rules that hold
only as long as every commit runs its hook.

`git commit --no-verify` is one flag. It is documented at the top of pre-commit
as turning off all of them, and it exists for good reasons. What makes it a
problem is not the bypass but that nothing downstream repeats the work: a rule
enforced at commit alone is a rule a single flag retires, and the tree then
carries the violation with every push gate green above it: a gate that runs at
commit only can sit failing on main while push reports every gate it calls
passing.

So the rule is the nesting the two lists already imply: every gate pre-commit
runs is reachable from the push tier too, or is named in COMMIT_ONLY with the
reason it cannot be. Push is the boundary that matters — it is where work stops
being local — and a check that does not run there is advisory.

What this cannot see. It reads invocations, not outcomes: a gate wired into both
hooks passes here while doing nothing in either, and a gate whose push
invocation is under a tier nobody runs counts as reached. It matches on the
script's filename, so a gate invoked through a variable holding its path is
invisible, and it takes reachability through check-style.py at face value rather
than confirming that file's own dispatch. Each of those is a way to satisfy this
gate without gaining the coverage it describes.
