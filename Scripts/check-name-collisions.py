"""check-name-collisions.py — one name, two namespaces, two values.

    Ubiquitty::Preferences::defaultScrollbackLines = 10000
    Ubiquitty::VT::defaultScrollbackLines     = 800

Both are legal, both are wanted, and which one an unqualified use means
depends only on the namespace it is lexically inside. That is fine until
something rewrites the use — adding a qualifier, moving a declaration between
namespaces, or adding an include that brings the other one into scope. A
textual rewrite discards exactly the enclosing scope that was distinguishing
them, so it can repoint a use at the other constant and the result compiles,
links, passes every test, and ships a different number.

A sweep that qualifies a name cannot see that the name was already ambiguous.
Nor can a collision check written to look for a second DEFINITION of one symbol
— that is a different question, and it answers clean here, because these are two
symbols rather than one symbol twice.

Reported only when the VALUES differ. Two namespaces agreeing on a constant is
a duplicate worth tidying, not a hazard: picking the wrong one changes nothing.

Namespace-scope declarations only, at column zero, which is where this codebase
puts them. A class member is qualified by its class and cannot be reached by an
unqualified use from another namespace.

What the count is and is not. A floor, never a ceiling. This matches a
`constexpr` with an initialiser, so a collision expressed as an enum member, a
macro, a non-constexpr constant, or a class name is invisible to it — a
namespace-scope alias is `--aliases`' question — and a clean run means the
rest were not looked for rather than not there. A count that implies more
than it checked is the same defect as a budget above the truth, and it reads
just as green.

    as one type, and that edit compiles
    at each use site that meant the other.

    Agreeing and differing targets both report, where the constants mode
    reports only differing values. Picking the wrong one of two agreeing
    constants changes nothing, ever; an agreeing alias pair is the latent
    form of a differing one, and the cheap moment to break the pair is when
    the second declaration appears rather than when the targets diverge.

    Ancestor, not merely different, for the reason the function mode gives: an
    unqualified use inside the inner namespace reaches both and enclosing
    lookup decides which it means, while siblings cannot see each other's
    declaration.
