"""check-approved-goldens.py — an approved golden keeps the bytes it was
approved with.

Tests/Snapshots/approved.tsv lists the goldens that were checked by eye, each
with the sha256 of its bytes. run.py refuses to re-mint one, but the runner is
one door: a golden can be overwritten by hand, checked out from another branch,
or deleted, and the manifest can be edited so that its hash follows the new
bytes. This closes those doors on the push path.

Three verdicts, each a failure:
  - a listed golden is missing;
  - a listed golden's bytes do not hash to the recorded value;
  - a line was rewritten in place: origin/main lists the same golden with a
    different hash. Replacing an approved picture takes two visible steps —
    delete the line and land that, then approve the new picture — so a hash
    that changes under a path that stays is the shortcut this refuses.

Removing a line is allowed (that is the unlock), and so is adding one.
