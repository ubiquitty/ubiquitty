# Scripts/check-enums.sh — WebKit bool/enum naming gate (companion to the
# acronym gate check-acronyms.py). Surfaces three WebKit-style smells:
#
#   - k-prefixed constants (kSomething)  → prefer an unprefixed `enum class` for
#     a related set, or a plain `constexpr` for a lone scalar. The k-prefix is a
#     Chromium convention, not WebKit. Only DEFINITIONS (`kXxx = …`) are flagged,
#     never the (many) uses, so the report stays one hint per constant.
#   - boolean function parameters (`(bool x`, `, bool y`)  → a descriptive enum,
#     even for two cases, so call sites read as intent not `true`/`false`.
#   - boolean NAMES that do not read as an assertion  → the predicate LEADS
#     (isVisible/hasFocus/shouldWrap/didLoad/canScroll) or it is a boolean
#     adjective (valid/empty/active). A subject-led `xIsY` (clientIsAgent) is not
#     the WebKit form — lead with is/has (isAgentClient).
#
# --staged / --since REF BLOCK newly-added violations (the ratchet, added lines
# only — mirrors check-comments.sh). The full-tree scan is ADVISORY — the
# existing backlog, chipped by the boy-scout rule, not a tree-wide block.
# Annotate a case the rule should not flag: // bool-ok, or /* bool-ok */ where a line
# comment cannot go — inside a multi-line macro a // swallows the backslash
# that continues it, so the block form is the only one available there.
#
# Usage (same surface as check-acronyms.py):
#   Scripts/check-enums.sh              # all tracked source — ADVISORY
#   Scripts/check-enums.sh --staged     # staged ADDED lines (pre-commit BLOCK)
#   Scripts/check-enums.sh --since REF  # ADDED lines vs REF (CI BLOCK)
#   Scripts/check-enums.sh file ...     # specific files
#   Scripts/check-enums.sh --self-test  # the rules against a planted fixture
#
# Exit 0 = clean, 1 = hints found, 2 = usage error.
#
# Wired into Scripts/hooks/pre-commit (--staged) and Scripts/check-style.py
# (--since origin/main, blocks the PR diff).

# The names a file already declared, so the ratchet owns what this change ADDED.
#
# A bool is its NAME, not the text of the line declaring it. A line edited for a
# reason that leaves the name alone -- a parameter type respelled by a rename, a
# field carried into a moved file -- adds no bool, and a ratchet that reads the
# changed LINE as a new declaration demands a rename of something that was
# already there. A module rename touches every `<field>Set` companion's line
# without moving its spelling.
#
# Two ways a file's history is not at its own path. A rename git can pair, given
# both paths in one diff. A path REUSED for different content it cannot: when
# one header is deleted and another moved onto its name, git reports one
# modified file with a whole-file diff and the pre-image knows none of the
# fields.
#
# So the pre-image is the file's own history at its path, PLUS every file this
# change removed. A name the change deleted from one place and added in another
# was moved, not written. Loose in the safe direction: this can only exempt, so a
# name it over-collects costs a report the ratchet would otherwise have made,
