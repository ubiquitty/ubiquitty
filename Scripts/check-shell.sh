# check-shell.sh — shellcheck over every tracked shell script, gated at zero.
#
# The tree already carried `# shellcheck source=…` directives in five scripts,
# annotations written for a tool no gate ran. What that cost is measurable: a
# refactor of check-comments.sh moved its records from a variable to a file and
# converted three of four modes, leaving `--staged` assigning to RECORDS while
# every consumer read RECORDS_FILE. shellcheck reports that as SC2034, and the
# pre-commit comment gate silently enforced nothing until someone noticed.
#
# Severity is `warning`. At `info` and `style` shellcheck reports preferences,
# and a finding a reader can reasonably reject is one that gets rejected.
#
# EXEMPTION: a script carries `# shellcheck-skip: <reason>` only where shellcheck
# cannot analyse it at all — it implements sh, bash, dash and ksh, so a zsh file
# has no dialect to check against and SC2148 is unanswerable. The count of
# skipped files is printed, because an exemption nobody sees is one that spreads.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/check-shell.sh          gate every tracked *.sh
#   Scripts/check-shell.sh PATH …   gate the named files
#
# Exit 0 = clean, 1 = findings.
