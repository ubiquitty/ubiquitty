"""Check that no tracked source file has quietly lost its contents.

Every other check in Scripts reads what a file says. That is a class with one
shared blind spot: a file with nothing in it violates nothing. The prose rules,
the boundary checks, the enum-switch walk and the name-collision scan all pass
over a Core source replaced by an empty file, because each of them looks for a
defect in content and there is no content to hold one.

Only a linker notices, and the symbol it names belongs to a function no change
in the diff mentions, so the error points away from the cause rather than at
it.

    open(path, "w").write(open(path).read().replace(a, b))

Python opens the write handle first, which truncates the file, so the read that
follows returns nothing and the replace writes it back empty. A rewrite loop over
many files does this silently and reports success.

Two bounds, because the first cannot catch a rewrite that leaves a stub.

    a tracked source file with no non-blank line     absolute, always checked
    a file that loses most of its bytes in a change  compared against the merge
                                                     base, when run with --diff

The first is the floor and it is cheap. The second is what catches a rewrite that
leaves a stub rather than nothing: five surviving lines out of a thousand is the
same defect and passes the floor.

The merge base is the basis, not the branch tip. A branch that started before an
unrelated deletion landed would read that deletion as its own. The base is the
tree this change was written against, so the comparison answers what the change
itself did.

A deletion is not a loss. A file removed on purpose is absent from the tree and
is not compared; only a file that still exists and has been hollowed out counts.

Nothing in the branch under check can excuse a reduction. Its author writes
every commit message and every file in it, so any marker it carried could be
written by the same hand, or the same script, that hollowed the file. An
intended reduction stays red until it lands: the decision to merge past this
check belongs to the reviewer of that change, and once it is on the base the
comparison no longer reads it as this branch's.

Stdlib only.
