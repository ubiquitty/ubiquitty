"""build-lane.py — builds in a few long-lived worktrees whose build roots stay warm.

A checkout's build root is named after the checkout's path (Scripts/build_root.py),
so a new worktree starts from an empty root and builds everything: the Swift,
the PGO-instrumented C++, ThinLTO and the link. ccache answers for the C++
compiles and for nothing after them. Ten agents each building in a worktree of
their own are ten such builds on one machine.

A lane is a detached worktree at a fixed path, so its root is the same root
from one user to the next. `run` takes a free lane, brings it to the caller's
tree, runs the command there, and lets the lane go when the command exits:

    python3 Scripts/build-lane.py run --wait 3600 --from "$PWD" -- Scripts/run-ui-tests.sh <scenario>
    python3 Scripts/build-lane.py run --from origin/main -- Scripts/build-tests.sh
    python3 Scripts/build-lane.py status
    python3 Scripts/build-lane.py root --lane 2
    python3 Scripts/build-lane.py --self-test

The lanes are `lane-1` to `lane-N` in the lanes directory: `--lanes-dir`, else
$UBQ_LANES_DIR, else `ubq-lanes` beside the repository's main checkout. N is
`--lanes`, else two on macOS, where at most two heavy builds share a machine,
and three elsewhere. A lane is created on first use, as a worktree of the
repository the other lanes belong to, or of the one this script is in.

Taking a lane. Each lane has a lock file beside it, `lane-N.lock`, held with
flock(2) for the whole run; the kernel releases it when the process ends,
however it ends. `lane-N.json` records the last taker: process, source, command
and start. A run tries the lane its source used last, then the others in
order; `--lane N` asks for one lane only. While every lane is held it prints
the holders and waits up to `--wait` seconds (0 by default), then exits 75. A
lane whose lock is free while a build process (ninja, a compiler, cmake, a
linker) still names it is passed over: its holder was killed and the build it
started was not.

Bringing the lane to the source. `--from` names a worktree (the current
directory by default) or a commit. A worktree contributes its HEAD and, on top,
its uncommitted changes: staged and unstaged through `git diff` and `git apply`,
and its untracked files unless `--no-untracked` is given. An untracked file over
64 MiB is left out and named. A worktree of another repository has its HEAD
fetched into the lanes' repository first. The lane's working tree then becomes
that tree exactly: what the last user changed, added or left mid-merge goes,
and ignored files stay, since build products are among them. Only files whose
content differs are written, so an unchanged file keeps its modification time
and ninja rebuilds what changed. HEAD is detached at the commit with the
changes staged, so a gate reading the index sees them.

Running. The command runs in the lane with UBQ_BUILD_ROOT set to the lane's
root and git's per-repository variables (GIT_DIR and the rest) removed, in a
session and process group of its own. SIGINT, SIGTERM and SIGHUP are passed on
to that group; a third signal sends SIGKILL. The lock is released when the command
ends, whatever its status, and the lane stays at that tree until the next run
replaces it.

Scripts/clean-build-roots.py keeps the root of every lane. Between runs a lane
is detached and clean at a commit main has, which is what a MERGED root looks
like.

Exit status: the command's, or 128 + N when signal N ended it; 2 = usage;
70 = the lane could not be created or brought to the source; 75 = no lane came
free within --wait.
