# format-code.sh — apply repository clang-format style to owned C/H source.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/format-code.sh              format files in place
#   ./Scripts/format-code.sh --check      dry-run; exit 1 if anything would change
#   ./Scripts/format-code.sh --swift-only  the Swift half alone
#   ./Scripts/format-code.sh --help       show this help
#
# --swift-only exists because the two halves need different machines. The
# C-family half is pinned to one clang-format major and the Swift half needs
# swift-format, which ships with the Swift toolchain and is on no Linux runner
# here — so the job holding the pinned clang-format cannot check Swift, and the
# job holding a Swift toolchain has a clang-format of its own that would
# disagree with the pin. Each half runs where its formatter is.
#
# Owned surface: Source/, Tests/, Support/Host/ (C and H files only).
# Excludes generated files (emoji_atlas_data.c), build artifacts, baselines,
# Resource files and Markdown are not C and are not touched by clang-format.

# The same set the pre-commit hook gates, derived from the same fact rather than
# restated: every tracked C-family file outside vendored ThirdParty. The hook
# judges STAGED paths with no directory allowlist at all, so any list here is a
# list that can be shorter than the one being enforced — and a file the hook
# gates but this script skips is one where the fix the hook names ("run
# ./Scripts/format-code.sh") does nothing and the commit is blocked with no way
# forward but --no-verify. A derived set cannot fall short of the hook's.
#
# `git ls-files` rather than `find`, so a build directory and an unconfigured
# checkout are outside the set without an exclusion to maintain — `--others
# --exclude-standard` keeps that property, because anything gitignored stays out.
#
# `--others` is what puts a file the tree does not track yet INSIDE the set. The
# hook judges staged paths, so a file being added is already in its subject
# while a tracked-only list has never heard of it: the author runs this script,
# is told the tree is clean, commits, and lands drift in the one kind of file
# that has never been formatted: a new one.
#
# Swift is formatted by swift-format against the repo's .swift-format, not by
# clang-format, which has no Swift language mode. Two formatters rather than one
# because the tree is two languages; the shape of the check is identical.
#
# Drift only, matching what this does for C-family. swift-format also lints —
# force-unwraps, naming, one-line doc summaries — and those are judgements the
# house conventions already rule on, in Docs/coding-conventions.md §3.4 and §2.
# A second opinion enforced by a tool would contradict the first wherever they
# disagree, and the one a reader is told to follow would lose.
#
# Objective-C++ is included — clang-format's ObjC language mode handles .mm/.h.
# The index still lists a file deleted in the working tree until the deletion is
# staged, and `git apply` of a patch that removes one leaves it exactly there.
# clang-format is then handed a path with nothing behind it, reports a diff
# against emptiness, and the run names a file that does not exist as needing
# formatting — which reads as this script being broken rather than as the tree
# being mid-apply. Ask the filesystem, which is what clang-format will do.
