# pgo-staleness.sh — shared staleness nudge for the PGO consumers
# (build-macos.sh, run-bench.sh). Sourced, not executed.
#
# The tolerance flags make a drifted profile degrade SILENTLY (functions fall
# back to plain -O3 placement one by one), so nothing ever surfaces the decay.
# pgo_staleness_warning counts commits touching Source/ since the profile's
# last commit and warns past a threshold — a nudge to rerun
# Scripts/pgo-train.sh, never a failure. Non-git trees (tarballs) and an
# untracked profile skip silently; a path that does not exist warns, because
# that is the caller getting it wrong rather than a tree without the profile;
# a profile trained at a commit this history lacks says, in one line, that its
# drift cannot be counted here.

# The sidecar naming the tree a profile was TRAINED on, beside the profile.
pgo_trained_at_path() { printf '%s.trained-at' "${1%.profdata}"; }

# The sidecar naming the Source/ TREE a profile describes.
pgo_trained_tree_path() { printf '%s.trained-tree' "${1%.profdata}"; }

# Whether the profile describes <ref>'s Source/ exactly.
#
# A commit name cannot answer this. The trained-at sidecar records one written
# in a worktree before the merge, and a rebase merge rewrites every commit it
# replays — so that sidecar names an object the tree may never have had, and
# the count below silently becomes a lower bound rather than a measurement. A
# tree hash is the content the replay preserves, so it compares the thing the
# question is actually about.

# The profile's own commit is the wrong reference and reads clean in exactly the
# case that matters. A profile trained in a worktree and merged with a rebase
# lands ON TOP of commits it was trained before, so the file's last-touched
# commit is newer than the counters inside it and the drift count reports zero
# while the artifact is stale.
#
# So the trained-at sidecar wins where it exists, and the file's commit is the
# fallback for a profile that predates it. A sidecar naming a commit this
# repository lacks answers nothing, and the fallback would answer wrongly: in a
# clone of a history that starts after the training, the file's commit is that
# history's first commit, and every commit of drift before it goes uncounted. That case returns 2 and prints
# nothing, so a caller can say the drift is unmeasurable here rather than small.
