"""check-standalone-tools-compile.py — a tool with its own runner still parses.

`Tests/CMakeLists.txt` builds every `bench_*`/`perf_*` under `Tests/`, so one that
stops compiling fails a push. Its sibling rule — "a file nothing names is a file
nothing checks. The naming convention is the registration" — does not reach
`Tools/` subdirectories: that glob is `file(GLOB "Tools/*.cpp")`, not recursive.

Three tools sat behind that edge and did not compile:

    Tools/reflow-bench/reflow_bench.cpp        3 errors
    Tools/reflow-bench/throughput_bench.cpp    1 error
    Tools/sgr-profile/sgr_bench.cpp            1 error

Two Core changes they never tracked, stacked so the first hid the second.
`Ubiquitty::Terminal` stopped arriving transitively through
`Core/TerminalOperations.h`, and under that, `Ubiquitty::resize` had moved from
`Terminal*` to `Terminal&`. Each tool has a `run.sh` that compiles and runs it, so
nothing was orphaned — but a runner nobody runs between API changes is a check
that arrives when someone reaches for a bench and finds it broken.

Syntax-only, because a full build of these costs minutes: each runner builds a
portable-core archive to link against. `-fsyntax-only` needs no archive, no link
and no PAL stub, and it catches every break of this kind — a moved declaration, a
changed signature, a renamed type. What it cannot catch is a link error, and that
is stated rather than implied.

Subjects are derived, not listed: every tracked `.cpp` under `Tools/` that no
CMakeLists names. A tool CMake builds is already covered by the build.

Stdlib only.
