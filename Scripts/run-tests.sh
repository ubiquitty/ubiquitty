# run-tests.sh — the host suite's single entry point.
#
# Most of the suite lives in Tests/CMakeLists.txt, which shares Core builds.
# This script hands off to CTest and supplies the shell stanzas for process
# setup, external clients, standalone build contracts, snapshots and fuzzers.
#
# Adding a test means dropping a `test_*.cpp` under Tests/<Subsystem>/. It is
# discovered and registered automatically; nothing here needs an entry. A stanza
# below owns setup or a build contract outside an ordinary unit-test invocation.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/run-tests.sh                 full CTest suite, then remaining stanzas
#   ./Scripts/run-tests.sh --list-stanzas   list the shell recipe names accepted here
#   ./Scripts/run-tests.sh test_host_tools  run one shell recipe, without CTest
#   ./Scripts/run-tests.sh test_host_tools gate_report
#                                          run a chosen set of shell recipes
#   ./Scripts/run-tests.sh --with-fuzz      full suite plus compile/run fuzzers
#   ./Scripts/run-tests.sh --fuzz-only      compile/run fuzzers only
#   FUZZ_REQUIRED=1 ./Scripts/run-tests.sh --fuzz-only
#                                          fail if a required fuzzer cannot run
#   ./Scripts/run-tests.sh --help           show this help
#
# Shell stanza names and individual CTest case names are different namespaces.
# Filters here select only names printed by --list-stanzas; they never select
# portable Core cases such as test_selection. Configure an explicit CTest tree
# to discover or run those cases (the build fixture builds their binaries):
#
#   CTEST_BUILD_DIR="$(python3 Scripts/build_root.py .)/BuildHostTests/ctest"
#   cmake -S . -B "$CTEST_BUILD_DIR" -G Ninja -DUBIQUITTY_FRONTEND=Core -DUBIQUITTY_BUILD_TESTS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
#   ctest --test-dir "$CTEST_BUILD_DIR" -N
#   ctest --test-dir "$CTEST_BUILD_DIR" -R '^test_selection$' --output-on-failure
#
# Set CTEST_BUILD_DIR to reuse a custom test tree. Otherwise the driver uses
# UBQ_OUT/ctest, with UBQ_OUT defaulting to the checkout's external build root
# plus BuildHostTests. Unavailable optional fuzz toolchains/runtimes print SKIP
# with reasons; FUZZ_REQUIRED=1 makes a skipped required harness fail the run.
# A harness that does not compile or link is BUILD-BROKEN and fails the run
# everywhere.
#
# Coverage is not here. Scripts/run-coverage.sh drives it through the CMake
# driver, which instruments the Core and the tests together — the only way
# llvm-cov attributes a Core line to the test that ran it.
#
# Filter arguments match bare shell stanza names (no path or source suffix).
# The default runs the CTest scheduler before the shell remainder; optional
# fuzzers require --with-fuzz or --fuzz-only.

# Every nested configure in this script funnels through here, so the coverage
# knob reaches the ~31 `cmake -B` sites without each having to remember it —
# including a stanza not yet written. The knob is passed explicitly in
# both directions because the Host build roots (build/host-tests, build/host-quic) are
# shared caches outside UBQ_OUT: a coverage run flips them ON, and a normal
# run that stayed silent would inherit instrumented binaries from the cache
# and never say so. `cmake --build` and `cmake -E` take no -D and pass
# through untouched.
#
# The QUIC prefix rides along for the same reason and one more. CMakeLists.txt
# declares UBIQUITTY_QUIC_PREFIX as a cache path, and cmake does not seed a
# cache entry from the environment variable of the same name: a configure that
# does not name it takes the build root's prefix whatever the environment says.
# Every stanza then links $QUIC_PREFIX, the environment's, against a tree
# configured for the default — the drift QUIC_PREFIX's own comment below claims
# the environment prevents.
#
# On a box whose build root sits outside the checkout it is worse than drift.
# Finding the default prefix empty, each configure runs fetch-quic-deps.sh to
# build AWS-LC there, and ctest locks a stanza only against the others sharing
# its build directory. These trees differ, so a dozen of them fetch into one
# default prefix at once and tear each other apart: a compiler that
# stops being detected mid-configure, an aws-lc/build directory that will not
# delete because another writer is in it, a dependency file that vanishes
# between opening and reading. Twenty stanzas reported a broken build, which
# asserts nothing. Passing the prefix here leaves configure and link naming one

# calls into BoringSSL and ngtcp2 and a link that names neither dies on an
# undefined BIO_* — which the harness reports as a broken build, meaning the
# stanza asserts nothing and still does not fail the run.
#
# Every such stanza must also compile its own translation unit with
# -DUBIQUITTY_QUIC=1, because `Daemon` declares a member under that macro:
# a test compiled without it sees a different layout from the objects it links
# against, reads `m_clients` and `m_sessions` at the wrong offsets, and spins on

# host_objects OBJDIR OUTFILE [extra-basenames-to-skip...]
#
# The objects CMake ACTUALLY links into the host target, minus main.cpp.o.
# Derived from CMake's own link line, not from `find OBJDIR -name '*.o'`.
#
# find walks the filesystem, so a source trimmed from the target leaves its stale
# .o behind and every stanza keeps linking it — forever, and silently, because the
# symptom is an undefined symbol from a TU that is no longer in the build: a
# source trimmed from the host subset leaves a .o that re-introduces its
# dependencies until the build dir is deleted by hand. A link line is
# regenerated by the build system,
# so it cannot carry an object the target no longer has.
#
# Where that line lives depends on the generator: Unix Makefiles writes link.txt,
# Ninja writes none and answers `-t commands` instead. Both are the same
# authority — what the target is actually linked from — so the invariant above
# holds either way, and neither is a filesystem walk.
# Compiles each source to its own object, at the machine's width, then links.
#
# `c++ a.cpp b.cpp c.cpp -o bin` compiles every unit inside one process, one
# after another, and ccache declines a multi-source command outright — so a
# stanza that names the whole of Core pays a full serial uncached build on every
# run, however warm the cache is. Per-unit compilation restores both properties:
# the units go out in parallel, and each one is a cache key of its own.
#
# The objects are named after the source path with the separators folded, so two
# sources cannot land on one object and a failure names the file that produced
# it.
#
# - Parameter binary: Where the linked result goes.
# - Parameter objectDirectory: Scratch for the objects and the compile log.
# - Parameter errorLog: Collects every unit's diagnostics.
# The rest is the compile flags, then `--`, then the sources.
# ubq_sanitized_binary — the binary under test carries the sanitizer runtime.
#
# The probe every sanitizer stanza runs before building compiles a two-line
# program with the flag and runs it. That answers whether the TOOLCHAIN has a
# runtime; it says nothing about the binary the stanza then produces, because it
# is a different compile of a different file. A stanza whose own flag went
# missing passes the probe, links an uninstrumented binary, runs it, reports
# nothing and exits 0 — which is the verdict a clean ASan run gives, spelled the
# same way.
#
# Decided by the runtime's own symbol, which the instrumented binary references
# and nothing else does. `undefined` is not decidable this way: UBSan emits a
# handler reference only where it inserts a check, so an absence is a fact about
# the code rather than about the build. Reporting it as uninstrumented would be
# an answer this cannot support, so it is named as undecided instead.
# The Host frontend, built once, printed as a path.
#
# Eleven stanzas run against this binary. Each configuring and building the tree
# itself would configure one directory eleven times so that one file could be
# read, and would make them hold a lock against each other. Reading a binary
# needs no lock; building it does.
#
# UBQ_HOST_PREBUILT says a fixture has already built it, which only ctest knows.
# Without that this builds on demand, because a stanza named on the command line
# has no fixture behind it and has to stay runnable on its own. Under ctest the
# fixture builds it whether or not a stanza was told so, and a stanza that was
# not refuses rather than build it a second time.
# A content fingerprint of the daemon's source. The daemon (ubiquitty-host) links
# Core, Base and Platform/Host; this hashes their working-tree content, so an edit
# to any of them changes the fingerprint. Content rather than mtime: in the Linux
# container cmake's incremental check can keep a daemon built before a Core
# change — measured: a from-scratch build carries a new outbound log string that
# the reused binary does not — under bind-mounted source and build trees whose
# mtimes it compares to the wrong conclusion. A stale daemon there is a
# silently wrong test: a Core fix reads as unverified, or a bug it removed reads as

# test_themes_uaf — AddressSanitizer negative for the custom-theme
# registry's pointer stability. The registry hands out a const Theme*
# (customGetInternal) that callers hold across a later registerCustom. It is a
# std::deque, whose elements never move on push_back, so a held pointer stays
# valid across registerCustom/replaceCustom (only clearCustom invalidates it);
# a std::vector's geometric growth would reallocate the backing buffer and free
# the old one, dangling every held Theme*.
# The test registers a theme, captures its internal pointer, registers 256 more
# to force what would be several vector reallocations, then reads a field
# through the held pointer. With the deque this is ASan-clean; reverting the
# registry to std::vector makes ASan report a heap-use-after-free READ at the
# held-pointer read (freed by registerCustom's realloc). ThemesCustom.cpp's only
# cross-TU dependency is builtInCount(), which the test stubs, so the registry

# takes the record in. A window left open across the stop keeps its pane, which
