# build-provenance.sh — shared build-directory freshness guard for the CMake
# frontends (build-host.sh, build-agent.sh, build-macos.sh). Sourced, not
# executed.
#
# An incremental build directory carries objects from whatever worktree state
# produced them. When that state differs from the current one, a link failure
# names symbols from the older objects, so the failure describes neither tree
# and attributing it to HEAD is wrong. The stamp records the revision and the
# worktree delta a build directory was last built from;
# build_provenance_warning compares it against the current state and refuses
# the attribution when they disagree. It is a notice, never a failure — the
# build proceeds either way. Non-git trees and unstamped directories are
# silent, because there is no claim to contradict.
#
# The build directory must be ignored by git (.gitignore carries build/), or
# the stamp lands inside the delta it measures and every build reports itself
# stale.

# _build_provenance_state <repository-root>
# Prints "<head-sha> <worktree-delta-digest>" for the current tree. The digest
# covers staged and unstaged tracked changes, so stashing or restoring work
# moves it even when HEAD does not.
