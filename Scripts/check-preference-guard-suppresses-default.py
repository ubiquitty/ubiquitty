"""A presence guard around an accessor read suppresses the default it supplies.

    if (c.ligatures.has_value())
        renderer.usesLigatures = Effective::ligatures(c);

The accessor answers `value_or(Defaults::ligatures)`. It has a default for
exactly the case the guard skips, so the guard can only ever prevent the default
from being applied — never change what happens when the key is set.

What that costs is not obvious from the line. It is a key deleted from
config.toml: the reload runs, the guard skips, and the last value the settings
pane wrote stays on screen until the next launch. The file says one thing and
the terminal shows another, with nothing to indicate which is which.

The comment beside `applyFontFeatures` says why:

    Unset means the file names no features, which is a value: a reader deleting
    the key expects the face's own defaults back, and skipping the call would
    leave the ones the pane last wrote standing.

`if (x.has_value())` is correct and common on its own -- around a `*x`, around
work that has no default to fall back to, around anything that is not this. Only
the pairing is refused: a guard on a key, and a body that reads that same key
through the accessor. That combination is redundant when it is
harmless and a deleted key that does not take effect when it is not.
