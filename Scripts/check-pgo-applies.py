"""check-pgo-applies.py — how much of the profile the compiler could still use.

`-fprofile-use` decides per function whether the recorded counters still describe
the body in front of it, and says so when they do not: a control-flow change
moves the function's CFG hash, the counters are discarded, and the body compiles
without them. Every build path in this tree suppresses that diagnostic —
build-macos.sh, build-perf-bench.sh and run-bench.sh all pass
`-Wno-backend-plugin` alongside the two `-Wno-profile-instr-*` flags — so the
loss is real, per-function, and invisible. This compiles the portable-core list
with those three restored and reports what the compiler said.

Why the mass and not the count. One orphaned function holding a billion counters
outranks fifty cold ones, and a count of functions treats them alike. The lines
carry `up to N count discarded`, so the output ranks itself by the quantity that
decides how much optimisation was actually lost.

Why not a commit count. `pgo-staleness.sh` answers how far the tree has moved
since the profile was trained, which is a proxy with five independent ways to be
wrong: the baseline (the file's own commit rather than the trained-at sidecar),
the operator (a date filter rather than ancestry), the scope (one subdirectory
quoted as the whole), the direction (`A..B` returns zero when B is behind A, not
an error and not a negative), and whose tree — the sidecar resolves to different
commits at different refs, so two checkouts can read the same number about different
pairs. None of them apply here, because this is not a comparison of refs. It is
what the compiler decided about these bodies against this profile.

The three ways a zero can arise, and why the denominator is printed. A zero means
the profile fits, or the diagnostics were suppressed after all, or nothing was
compiled — and a warm build directory emits nothing for what it does not rebuild,
which looks exactly like a perfect profile. So the count of translation units
that actually compiled in this run is reported beside the finding, taken from
this run rather than from the source list, and a run that compiles nothing
refuses rather than reporting a ratio over an empty population.

The profile is identified by content, not by path. `Support/pgo/portable-core.profdata`
is a different blob in every worktree that has not converged, so a figure quoted
without the blob it describes cannot be checked by anyone else.

A verdict needs a budget, and the caller supplies it. That a function lost its
counters says its own placement is gone; it does not say the body was compiled as
though no profile existed, because its callees' counters are still valid and the
module's summary thresholds still move it. So the mass is a number to compare
against a threshold rather than a failure on its own.

Both callers supply one. `pgo-train.sh` passes `--max-discarded 0`: a freshly
trained profile that already discards anything describes a tree it was not
trained on. `pre-push-gates.sh` passes `--max-new-discarded 30000` against
`origin/main`, a figure measured from this tree's own drift and recorded at that
call site.

`pre-push-gates.sh` asks the whole-tree question as well, with
`--recorded-budget`: the total the profile discards against this tree, against
the budget `pgo-train.sh` recorded beside the profile at the retrain. The
diff-scoped bound reads one push at a time and only the units it changed —
`changed_sources` keys on the portable-core unit list, so a header edit that
reshapes every function inlining it compiles nothing there and reads zero. What
the per-push bound cannot add up, the recorded budget does. Measured 2026-10-28,
two days after a retrain whose every unit discarded nothing: 81 functions and
13,305,832,948 counters detached — the byte loop, the character emitters, the
scroll and the cell-instance walk among them — with every push between the two
under the per-push bound.

A compiler that cannot read the profile stands the gate down. GCC takes a
directory of .gcda files rather than LLVM's format, and a clang older than the
LLVM that wrote the profile refuses its format version; every build on such a
machine compiles without the profile, so there is no application to measure.
The question is put through Scripts/pgo-flags.sh, which is what decides whether
a build is handed the profile, and the run prints a SKIPPED line naming the
compiler and exits 0. UBIQUITTY_PGO=REQUIRE, as CI's PGO stages set, turns the
stand-down into a refusal, the way it turns a build without the profile into a
failure.

What this cannot see, so that a zero is read for what it is. The diagnostic
covers a body the profile KNEW and no longer matches. A body the profile never
knew — a function added since the last retrain — compiles with no counters and
draws no diagnostic at all: measured, by compiling a namespaced function absent
from the profile and confirming the emitted symbol against an empty diagnostic
stream. So a clean run means nothing here has DRIFTED, not that everything here
is profiled. `check-profile-orphans.py` is the closest signal for the other half,
and it compares namespace paths rather than symbols, which is approximate by
construction and says so.
