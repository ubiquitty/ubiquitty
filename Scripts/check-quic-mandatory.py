"""check-quic-mandatory.py — shipping native builds include QUIC.

QUIC is how every native frontend reaches a host, and the daemon that terminates
it is bundled into the shipped app. A build that quietly drops it produces
something that runs, answers, and cannot reach a host the way the product does —
which is not a failure any test of behaviour catches, because the binary is
correct for a transport nobody ships.

One target genuinely cannot have it. A browser exposes no raw UDP socket to
wasm, so ngtcp2 has nothing to send on, and AWS-LC wants a native platform
underneath; the web frontend reaches a host through the page's own socket
instead. That is a property of the sandbox rather than a preference, so the two
wasm configures pass -DUBIQUITTY_QUIC=OFF and are the only ones allowed to.

Three things are compared, because the guarantee needs all three and any one of
them can move without the others noticing:

  - the option still defaults ON, so a configure that says nothing gets QUIC
  - the host still forces it ON, so the daemon in the bundle cannot lose it
  - only the wasm pair and the named in-memory regression gate turn it off

A README or a comment may name the flag: prose describing how to configure a
Core-only tree is not a build that ships. Only an actual -D on a cmake line
counts, which is the difference between documenting the escape hatch and taking
it.
