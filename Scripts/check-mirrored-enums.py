"""check-mirrored-enums — a mirrored enum numbers its enumerators explicitly.

An enum declared in one place has no numbering problem: the values are whatever
the order says, and the order is the only spelling there is. Two declarations of
one concept are different. `Codec::PNG::DecodeStatus` and `Image::TIFF::
DecodeStatus` share five enumerator names, both positional, and already disagree
on two of them — `Unsupported` is 4 in one and 3 in the other. Nothing converts
between them today. Nothing would report it if something did: every value is in
range for both, so the cast succeeds and names the wrong failure.

The rule is that a MIRROR pins its values. Not every enum — pinning fifty
enumerators of an enum with no twin makes the numbers meaningless noise and buys
nothing, and a rule that demanded it would be argued with rather than obeyed.

Why not name-collision. `Direction`, `Kind` and `State` are each declared in
several files as unrelated concepts in unrelated namespaces. A gate firing on
those fires eleven times for no defect and teaches its readers to scroll past
it, which costs more than it catches.

Why not an exemption list. `Keys::VirtualKey` is positional and correct; its
macOS twin pins every value to an AppKit hardware constant, so that one's order
carries nothing to lose. Both facts are derivable, and a hand-kept list of
"enums that are fine" goes stale the first time one stops being fine.

The parse is the risk, so it fails loud. A scan that drops an enumerator
under-reports overlap, which EXCUSES a real mirror, and invents one-enumerator
enums, which INVENTS mirrors that are not. Both directions at once is how a gate
gets discounted. So a body that yields no enumerators, or an entry that is not
an identifier, is a parse failure that fails the run — never an enum that
happens to be empty.
