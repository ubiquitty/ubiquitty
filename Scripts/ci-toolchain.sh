# Scripts/ci-toolchain.sh — decide whether a CI job needs to install anything.
#
# A runner that keeps its packages between runs would spend a package-manager
# metadata load and a dependency resolution on each install step to conclude
# that every package is already present. Presence alone is the wrong question to
# skip on: it cannot tell a toolchain that moved under the job from one that did
# not, and a compiler that changed major version is the thing a job most wants
# named.
#
# So what is compared is the resolved version of every tool the job asked for,
# against what the last successful install recorded. The stamp lives on the
# runner, which is the thing whose state is being remembered; a runner with no
# stamp installs once and records. A GitHub-hosted image starts every job
# without one, so there `check` costs one version probe and the install runs.
#
# The workflow files are compared too. They are where the package list is
# written, and a package that provides no command of its own -- a header set, a
# driver -- changes what a job needs without changing any version this can read.
# Any edit to a workflow costs one install per runner, which is the conservative
# side of a question that cannot be answered by looking at the binaries.
#
#   ci-toolchain.sh check  <group> <tool>...   0 = satisfied, skip the install
#   ci-toolchain.sh record <group> <tool>...   write the stamp after installing
#
# `check` prints what it found, because a job that skipped its install and then
# failed to compile needs the version it skipped on in the same log.
