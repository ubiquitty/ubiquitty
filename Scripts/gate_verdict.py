"""gate_verdict — a gate's verdict is a fact about the tree it read.

The same cache Scripts/gate-verdict-cache.sh implements, for callers that are
python. Both must key alike: a python runner and a shell runner that disagree
about the key would each replay the other's misses and neither would be wrong
about anything a reader could see.

What goes in the key, and why each part has to:

  the tree's content     tracked and untracked alike. A file the tree does not
                         track yet can carry the violation, and a key blind to
                         it replays a pass taken before the file existed.
  the build's state      some gates answer about compiled output rather than
                         source — nm over BuildHostTests, an executable under
                         build/ — and those bytes are gitignored, so the tree
                         fingerprint cannot see them.
  the fork point         a gate given a ref asks what this branch changed, which
                         is the merge base and not the ref's tip, so a teammate
                         landing on main leaves these verdicts standing and a
                         rebase retires them.
  the command            the same script asked a different question is a
                         different verdict.
  the toolchain          shellcheck, clang-format and python differ between
                         machines and versions.

Only a pass is remembered. A red verdict is re-asked on the next run, because a
retry after a failure is someone asking whether it is fixed, and answering that
from a cache answers a different question.

A stand-down is not a pass. A gate that found no tool or no build says so with a
"<gate>: SKIPPED" line and exits zero, having checked nothing. What it looked for
is often outside the key: the smokes read an app or a GTK binary under build
roots the build digest does not walk. Kept, the stand-down was replayed after the
build appeared, and the smokes read SKIPPED with both builds present.

The fingerprint is taken one time, before any gate runs.
Scripts/check-gate-subjects plants an untracked file and removes it again, and a
key that moved underneath the run would store verdicts under keys that never
recur.
