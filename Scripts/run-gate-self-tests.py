"""run-gate-self-tests.py — every gate that advertises a self-test runs it.

A gate here reports nothing on a clean tree, which is the same output it would
produce if its rule had stopped matching anything at all. That is why so many of
them carry a `--self-test`: the self-test runs the rule against a construct it
must catch and one it must not, so a clean verdict is evidence rather than an
absence. `check-empty-array-expansion` says it outright — the self-test is what
"settles which".

A self-test nothing executes is unwatched rather than rotten, and the
difference cannot be seen until it runs. A control nobody runs is not evidence
that it works, and the day one of them stops catching its own planted defect is
the day it stops being worth its lines — silently, because the gate it guards
still prints ok.

Discovered rather than listed. A per-gate stanza lets unrun self-tests
accumulate: adding a gate gives nobody a reason to edit a list of gates, so
each omission is invisible on its own and the total is never counted. Anything
named `check-*` that mentions `--self-test` in its own text is run here, so a
new gate is covered without anyone remembering to add it.

Discovery that finds nothing must fail rather than pass quietly, which is the
same defect this file exists to close one level up: a driver reporting "0 of 0
self-tests passed" reads exactly like a clean run. The canaries below are the
floor — gates whose self-tests `run-tests.sh` already depends on, so a pattern
that stops matching them is a broken scan and not a shrinking tree.

Stdlib only.
