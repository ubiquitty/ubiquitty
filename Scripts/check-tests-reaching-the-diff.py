"""check-tests-reaching-the-diff.py — run the tests this branch can break.

The whole suite is not in the push tier: several checkouts can share one
machine, and each of them running every entry before every push is the largest
single load on it. Running nothing instead lets a break through — a change adds
a row to the `Key.h` descriptor table without the row `test_preferences_keys`
hand-copies beside it, that test asserts the two tables are the same length,
and the count is one short on every platform while every gate that ran is
green, because `Tests/ compiles` compiles and does not run.

So neither all of them nor none: the ones the change reaches.

    ./Scripts/check-tests-reaching-the-diff.py <build-dir> [--changed-from REF]

Ninja already holds the answer, and `check-build-reached.py` already reads it
for a different question. Its dependency database records, per object, every
file the compiler actually OPENED — headers and the source alike, not the
includes a file declares and not what a grep of include lines would guess. So a
changed file names the objects that read it, an object names its target through
the `CMakeFiles/<target>.dir/` path CMake gives it, and a target that ctest
registers is a test to run. A settings change selects five tests where the suite
runs three hundred, and `test_preferences_keys` is one of the five.

This is the reason the step is cheap enough to be unconditional: the tier
already builds this directory for `Tests/ compiles`, so the database is warm and
the objects are current. What is added is the RUN, and only of what was named.

Three ways a selector like this passes without running, all closed here.

A missing or unreadable dependency database selects nothing, and nothing is what
a green run looks like. That REFUSES instead — the database is the whole
instrument, and a gate that cannot read its instrument has not measured
anything.

A name ctest does not know silently narrows `-R` to the names it does know, so a
target renamed out from under this would quietly stop being covered. Every
selected name is checked against `ctest -N` first and an unknown one refuses.

And a `-R` pattern can match fewer entries than it names — several names
collapsing to one is exactly how a runner reports a green over a set it never
ran. So the check is not on ctest's total: every selected name must appear in
the run's own per-test lines, and one that does not refuses whatever the rest
of them said. The total cannot serve, because ctest pulls in the fixtures a
selected test requires (`ubq_build` is a FIXTURES_SETUP entry every test in
this directory needs) and legitimately runs more entries than were asked for.

A fourth: a source only another frontend compiles. This directory builds the
Core frontend, so `Source/Platform/Host/Daemon.cpp` is read by no object here,
and the database alone reports it as reaching nothing and passes. The host
stanzas that link it are ctest entries all the same
(`shell_foreground_probe_budget` and its siblings build the host themselves),
and any of them can be red behind that report. For a file no object here reads,
the coverage index
(`Tests/coverage/covering-tests.tsv`, which records the tests whose run
executed each file) names the entries to run. Only for those files: the index
lists dozens of host stanzas under every Core header, and running them for a
header the dependency database already answers for is the whole suite again.

A fifth: a stanza that builds a CMake test's own source from a hand-written
list (`shell_test_pty` beside `test_pty`). The database names the CMake target,
which links the Core library and passes, while the stanza's list can fall
behind a case that reaches into Core and stops at the link. A selected test
therefore brings the stanza of the same name.

A sixth: a stanza whose subject is not in this directory at all. The agent
smokes run `ubq`, built in a tree of its own from a trimmed Core, and are shell
scripts. No object here is theirs, and the coverage index has no line for them
either, since the binary they run is not the instrumented one. `ubq_smoke`
asserts the list of Sync methods `ubq api list` prints, and a method joining
`MethodRegistry.cpp`, which only the library's object reads, selects nothing
from the database. So the driver's own recipes
are read: a changed file under Tests/ that a stanza's recipe names selects the
stanza, and a changed file the agent's build read selects the stanzas that run
the agent. The agent's tree alone: the host links all of Core, and every host
stanza for every Core change is the suite again.

A seventh: a stanza that runs a gate script over the tree. Its subject is
whatever the script reads, which is neither an object nor a file under Tests/:
`test_only_operations` runs `Scripts/check-test-only-operations.py`, which reads
`Source/Core/TerminalOperations.h` and searches the shipping directories for a
caller of each operation it declares. An operation added to that header with
no caller selects the tests that compile the header, and not the one stanza
that would say so. So a script a recipe runs is read as
`check-gate-scopes.py` reads a gate's: the repository paths it spells, comments
excluded, are the stanza's inputs, and a changed file that is one of them, or
lies under a directory that is, selects the stanza. The script itself is an
input too. The same lower bound applies as there: a spelled path is seen and a
computed one is not. Only a stanza that is nothing but gate scripts is read
this way. One that also compiles a test or runs a product is answered for by
the rules above, and the scripts it runs on the way are its tooling: the
snapshot stanza rebuilds its renderer through a build script that spells half
the tree, and running every arm for each of those paths is the suite again.

An eighth: a stanza that builds tests this directory also builds, another way.
`sanitized_sync` builds the Sync, Session and Runtime unit tests under
AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer in a tree of its own, where a
read of freed memory that the plain runs of those same tests pass is caught. Its
recipe names its tests by glob, so a selected test whose source a recipe's
glob matches brings that stanza, whatever the change reached the test through.

An eighth, the other way round: a stanza selected where it only declines. The
sanitizer stanza runs on macOS alone and answers with a skip anywhere else, and
the index names it under most of Core, so a Linux run would select it for
nearly every change to print that it will not run. A stanza whose opening line
says it declines off macOS is left out of the selection there, and said to be.

A ninth: the fourth way, reopened where the daemon is compiled here. A Linux
test tree builds an object from `Source/Platform/Host/Daemon.cpp`, so the file
reaches an object and the coverage index would not be consulted for it, so a
revocation change would select none of the `revoke_*` stanzas that exercise the
daemon. A file under the host's own tree (HOST_OWNED) therefore always brings
the index's entries as well, whatever objects read it. The host's tree only:
under a Core header the index names dozens of host stanzas, and the database
already answers for those.
