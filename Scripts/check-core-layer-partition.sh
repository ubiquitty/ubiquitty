# check-core-layer-partition.sh — the L0/L1/L2 partition of the portable-core
# source list, classified by the rules in Docs/package-layers.md.
#
# Scripts/portable-core-sources.txt stays the single source of truth for what
# the core lib compiles; this checker classifies every SSOT line into its
# package layer by rule (module prefix + three exact Platform paths), so there
# is no second file list to drift. The partition must be TOTAL and UNAMBIGUOUS:
# an SSOT line matching no rule (a new module, a new Protocol/ subtree, a new
# Platform TU) FAILS here until Docs/package-layers.md assigns it a layer —
# that is the guard, not an inconvenience.
#
# Layer rules (Docs/package-layers.md):
#   L0  foundation + PAL contract:  Support/ (no TUs in the SSOT), and the
#       portable PAL sources: PAL/PAL.cpp, PAL/TaskQueue.cpp, PAL/OutputQueue.cpp,
#       PAL/Process.cpp, PAL/ProcessSignal.cpp and PAL/RemoteTarget.cpp.
#   L1  model:      Core/ Unicode/ Codec/ Image/ Rendering/ Protocol/Tmux/
#                   Diagnostics/ Ubiquitty/
#   L2  behaviour:  App/ Preferences/ Themes/ Terminfo/ Input/ Runtime/
#                   Selection/ Protocol/Sync/ Transport/ Network/ Session/
#   L3b bundled backend: Platform/POSIX/ and the Platform/Wasm/ TUs that
#       replace it — architecturally backends (L3), bundled into the core lib as
#       the default PAL; kept distinct here so the model/behaviour split never
#       counts them as model code.
#       Both spellings are classified because CMakeLists swaps one set for the
#       other, and the partition is checked against whichever the target builds.
#
# There is no generic Protocol/ rule, because Protocol is split across layers
# (Tmux=L1, Sync=L2): a catch-all would file a new Protocol/<other>/ TU under
# whichever layer it named, so each must be classified explicitly instead.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/check-core-layer-partition.sh              verify; per-layer counts
#   Scripts/check-core-layer-partition.sh --emit L1    print one layer's TUs
#   Scripts/check-core-layer-partition.sh --sources F  override the SSOT (tests)
