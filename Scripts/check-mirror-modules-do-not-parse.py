"""check-mirror-modules-do-not-parse.py — a mirrored Terminal has no parser.

`Terminal::currentCapabilityOrigin` is value-initialised, and `Local` is the
first enumerator, so every Terminal in the tree carries Local unless something
says otherwise. Nothing ever stamps `Agent` or `Remote`: the four explicit stamps
are all Local. That is not an oversight, and this gate is what keeps it from
becoming one.

It is correct because of a structural fact rather than a stamp. A Terminal whose
parser runs is fed by its own session, so Local is true of it. A Terminal fed
over the sync protocol is a mirror: `SyncClientCore` applies snapshots and row
deltas straight into the grid and never calls `processBytes`, so a mirrored
Terminal reaches no capability gate site at all and its origin is never asked.
Local is then unread rather than wrong.

Route host bytes into a mirror's parser and both halves fail at once: the gate
sites become reachable, and they answer for a principal the wire does not carry.
The daemon knows who is driving; `CapabilityOrigin` has no field for it. The fix
at that point is a protocol change, which is a great deal larger than the line
that caused it.

So the rule is that a module holding a `SyncClientCore` does not feed a parser.
The modules are derived rather than listed, so a mirror added later is covered
without anyone remembering this file.

Web is the one exception, and the reason it needs its own gates rather than a
line here: it both mirrors a host and parses its own bytes, which is the pair
this rule forbids everywhere else. `Scripts/check-web-parser-entries.py` records each of its parser
entries with why the bytes are local, and `Scripts/check-web-host-bytes.py` holds
the page half. The exemption is a pointer at two gates that check it, not a hole.

Stdlib only.
