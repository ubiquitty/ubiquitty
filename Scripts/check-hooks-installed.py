"""check-hooks-installed.py — the gates a clone thinks it has are the ones it has.

Every other gate here assumes it runs. `Scripts/install-hooks.sh` is what makes
that true, and nothing invokes it: CONTRIBUTING tells a reader to run it once
per clone, and `Scripts/test-install-hooks.sh` tests it against a throwaway
clone. Being tested is not being run — the same distinction check-gates-invoked
draws about gates, arriving one level lower, at the thing that installs them.

Three states leave a clone gated by less than it appears to be, and none of
them announces itself:

    absent          a gating hook is missing, so what it runs gates nothing.
    symlinked       the hook links into one worktree's Scripts/hooks.
    not executable  the hook is present and correct but lacks its execute bit;
                    git skips it in silence, and every check a reader makes by
                    opening the file says it is fine.

The second is why this checks the hook's shape rather than its presence. Linked
worktrees share one hooks directory, so a hook symlinked into a particular
worktree gates every worktree with that one tree's copy: its idea of which gates
exist, at whatever commit it has checked out, or nothing once it is removed and
the link dangles. `hooks-dispatch` is installed as a copy and runs the hook from
whichever tree git is operating on, so a symlink is never the intended install.

What this cannot do, stated because the gap is the point: it cannot help the
clone that has no hooks, because the places it runs from are the ones that do not
run there. It reports for whoever asks — a person running check-style, or a
push on a clone whose hooks are half-installed. Closing the rest needs a trigger
that fires without a hook, and the build is the only one every checkout reaches.

It fails rather than advising. A checkout with no hooks never reaches this
verdict at push time anyway, so failing cannot obstruct it; it reaches someone
running check-style by hand, for whom a line naming install-hooks.sh is the
answer they came for.

To test this script, never point `git config core.hooksPath` at an empty
directory to watch it fail. Linked worktrees share one .git/config, so that
disables every hook for every worktree of that clone, silently, until someone
unsets it. Use a one-shot environment override instead:

    GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=core.hooksPath \\
    GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=/tmp/empty python3 Scripts/check-hooks-installed.py

Stdlib only.
