# Bound the compile fan-out. `cmake --build -j` with no number hands ninja its

# fetch-quic-deps.sh — build the QUIC stack (ngtcp2 + AWS-LC) the daemon's QUIC
# transport links against, into a prefix the CMake `-DUBIQUITTY_QUIC=ON` build
# finds. Pinned to exact COMMITS, verified after checkout: a tag is a mutable ref,
# and this source is compiled into the notarised app and the release host binary,
# so whoever can move a tag upstream chooses what ships. The tags are kept beside
# the commits because a reader needs to know which release a commit is. Idempotent
# (skips when the libs are already present and reuses cached source clones when
# rebuilding). Run before
# configuring with UBIQUITTY_QUIC on:
#
#   ./Scripts/fetch-quic-deps.sh            # → <build root>/quic-deps
#   ./Scripts/fetch-quic-deps.sh <prefix>   # → custom prefix
#
# AWS-LC is the TLS crypto backend; ngtcp2's boringssl crypto backend natively
# detects it (HAVE_AWSLC). AWS-LC needs Go + Perl on PATH to build (it generates
# assembly + tables); both are present on the build hosts.

# Every git command below names a dependency clone with `git -C`, and `-C` only
# sets the working directory — an inherited GIT_DIR skips discovery entirely and
# wins. CMake reaches this script from a configure step, and a configure step is
# reachable from the pre-push hook, where git exports GIT_DIR pointing at the
# pushing worktree. Measured there, in a fresh worktree:
#
#     git -C build/quic-deps/src/aws-lc config --get remote.origin.url
#       -> https://github.com/ubiquitty/ubiquitty
#     git -C build/quic-deps/src/aws-lc fetch origin refs/tags/v5.1.0:...
#       -> fatal: couldn't find remote ref refs/tags/v5.1.0
#
# The tag is missing because the command is asking the wrong repository. The
# `switch --detach` further down is the one that costs work rather than an error:
# aimed at the pushing worktree, it moves the developer's HEAD.
