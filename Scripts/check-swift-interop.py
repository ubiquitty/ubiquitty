"""check-swift-interop.py — the Swift toolchain is reached through one header.

<swift/bridging> ships only with the Swift toolchain, so a direct include
compiles on a Mac and breaks every Linux translation unit. A bare SWIFT_*
attribute is worse than an error: it is defined only when that header was found,
so where it is absent the annotation sits there doing nothing.

Both go through Source/Base/SwiftInterop.h, which includes the header behind
__has_include and republishes the attributes under UBIQUITTY_* spellings that
expand to nothing when the toolchain is not there.

  Scripts/check-swift-interop.py

Exit 0 = clean, 1 = sites reaching the toolchain directly, 2 = the scan reached
nothing.
