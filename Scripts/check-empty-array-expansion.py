"""Finds array expansions that abort the script on the bash macOS ships.

macOS ships bash 3.2, where `"${arr[@]}"` on an EMPTY array is an unbound
variable rather than zero words. Under `set -u` that aborts the script at the
expansion, so an array filled conditionally kills its own script on exactly the
machine the script is written for. bash 4.4 and later expand it to nothing, so
the same script is correct everywhere else and the failure only reaches the
developer running it locally.

shellcheck does not report this at any severity — it is a version behaviour, not
a syntax question. So there is nothing else in the tree that can see it.

The guard is `${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}`: nothing when the array is unset, the same
quoted elements when it is not. The populated expansion is unchanged, so
applying it does not turn on whether a given array can reach empty.

## What is reported

An expansion is reported when every one of these holds:

  - the file sets `-u` (otherwise the expansion is merely empty, not fatal)
  - the array is initialised empty somewhere (`arr=()`), which is what makes an
    empty state reachable at all
  - the expansion is bare `"${arr[@]}"`, not either guard form
  - the file tests `${#arr[@]}` nowhere, since an author who counts the array
    has the empty case in hand and may be guarding by branch

The last two conditions are what keep this from reporting the whole tree, and
they are also where it goes blind: a file that counts one array and expands a
different one bare is not reported. A pass that reports more than a reader acts
on gets muted, and a muted pass finds nothing at all.
