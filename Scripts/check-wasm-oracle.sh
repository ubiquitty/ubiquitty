# check-wasm-oracle.sh — the wasm arm catches a break the host misses, proven
# freshly rather than cited from history.
#
# gate_wasm (pre-push-gates.sh) builds portable Core under emscripten on the
# claim that wasm32's toolchain rejects shapes a 64-bit host accepts, so the arm
# catches Core/Base breaks no host lane does. That claim is only worth a minute
# of every Core push while the two toolchains disagree, and any one source shape
# that separates them can stop separating them when either toolchain changes.
#
# This holds the claim to a fixture that disagrees by construction: a
# static_assert that a pointer is 64-bit, which a 64-bit host passes and wasm32
# fails. Compiled under both, the host must accept it and wasm must reject it. If
# a toolchain change ever made them agree, the arm would compile a broken Core
# and say ok; this goes red here first, naming the arm that stopped disagreeing.
#
# SKIPPED, not passed, when emscripten is absent — gate_wasm's own shape.
