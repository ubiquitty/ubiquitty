"""Check that a file named in prose is a file that exists.

A comment or a document that names a source file is a navigation instruction.
"Defined in OSCColor.cpp", "see VT.h", "the arrangement GlyphAtlas.swift uses" —
each tells a reader where to go next, and each is the only link between the two
places. Nothing compiles prose, so when the file is split, renamed or moved the
pointer stays behind and keeps giving the same directions to somewhere that is
not there.

Comments and Markdown are one population because the defect is one defect. The
difference is only in extraction: a source file is reduced to its comments,
and a document is prose from the first line, so it is read whole — running it
through the comment extractor would blank the backticked spans, which is exactly
where a document puts a path.

It fails the way a wrong sign fails rather than the way a missing one does. A
reader who follows "OSCColor.cpp" finds nothing and concludes the function is
gone, or greps the basename, finds `Color.cpp`, and cannot tell whether that is
the same thing renamed or a different thing that happens to fit. Both readings
cost more than no pointer would have.

Two bounds, and they differ in what they can prove.

    a name this repository once tracked and no longer does   always fails
    a name this repository never had                         allowlisted below

The first needs no exemption and never will. Git holds both halves of it: the
path was in the tree, the path is not in the tree, and no reading of those two
facts makes the pointer right. That is the whole of the rot this check exists
for — our own file moved, and the comment stayed.

The second cannot be settled from the tree, because a name that was never here
is as likely to be a citation of somebody else's source as a mistake. libX11's
`ParseCol.c`, tmux's `control.c` and XNU's `bsd/kern/tty.c` are named for the
same reason a paper cites a page number, and asking whether they are tracked
here answers nothing.

A design document adds a third case: it names the files a plan would create, and
until the plan lands the reference is doing its job by not resolving. Those are
keyed by site rather than by name — the same spelling is rot in any file that is
not the document proposing it.

A name is compared only if it is ours to begin with. Every `#include <...>` and
`#import <...>` spelling anywhere in the tree is collected first, so `unistd.h`
is never read as a claim about this repository.

Three shapes are filtered before matching, each a filename in appearance only.

    a one-character stem      `M.m` is BCD version notation, `A.cpp` is a
                              stand-in in a script's usage text
    a glob                    `*.tables.inc` names a set to expand, and a match
                              starting inside it reads as a missing file
    a slash-joined pair       a directory does not end in `.cpp`, so
                              `a.cpp/b.cpp` is two names, not one path

Stdlib only.
