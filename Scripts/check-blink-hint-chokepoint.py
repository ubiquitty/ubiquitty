"""check-blink-hint-chokepoint.py — the blink hint and its stamp move together.

`CellGrid` carries a conservative DECBLINK hint: `hasBlinkHint()` true MAY mean a
Blink cell exists, false means none does. A frontend's animation clock rests on
it — `FrameClock.swift` guards on `frameClockHasAnimatingContent`, so a hint that
is true forever is a terminal that redraws forever, and one that is false while a
Blink cell is on screen is a cursor that stops blinking.

Because sticky-true is safe and stale-false is not, a viewer that scanned the
whole grid and saw no Blink cell may retract the hint for itself — but only if
its scan is not older than the most recent blink-attributed write. That is what
`m_blinkHintGeneration` records, and the retraction is only sound while the stamp
cannot be older than the flag it describes.

`noteBlinkWrite` is what makes that true. It sets both, and the eight arming
sites call it: the per-cell, known-diff, row-span, ASCII-run, deferred-blank,
fill and wide-pair write paths. Before it existed, eight sites assigned the flag
directly and a stamp added to three of them would have left the other five
publishing a stamp older than their own blink.

This gate holds the choke point rather than the count. The count is not the
invariant — a ninth write path is ordinary and welcome, and it is safe the moment
it calls `noteBlinkWrite`. What is not safe is a site that assigns the flag
itself, which is invisible in review precisely because it looks like the eight
lines it replaces, and which fails nothing at runtime: the flag is still armed,
so the terminal still blinks, and the only symptom is a viewer retracting against
a stamp that predates the write.

So: the flag is armed in one place, and every assignment to either name is paired
with the other.

Three shapes are allowed, and each pairs:

    noteBlinkWrite        flag = true,  stamp = m_damageGeneration
    clearBlinkHintIfClean flag = false, stamp = 0
    the constructor       both in the initialiser list

A fourth is what this rejects.

Stdlib only.
