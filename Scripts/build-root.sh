# build-root.sh — where a checkout's build output goes, for shell callers.
#
# Sourced, not run:
#
#     . "$(dirname "$0")/build-root.sh"
#     cmake -S "$ROOT" -B "$UBQ_BUILD_ROOT/macos"
#
# Outside the checkout. A build tree inside a worktree makes `git status` slow,
# makes every removal of a worktree a decision about gigabytes, and leaves the
# artefacts behind when the worktree goes, including in a worktree whose
# repository has already lost track of it.
#
# The layout is Xcode's, for Xcode's reason: a name a person can read, and a
# hash so two checkouts sharing a basename cannot collide.
#
#     ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/<basename>-<16 hex of the path's md5>
#
# Xcode's own directory, so Xcode's "Delete Derived Data" and the Storage pane
# in System Settings clear these too. Xcode names its own <Name>-<28 lowercase
# letters>; a hex digest cannot collide with that and says which entries are
# ours.
#
# On non-macOS hosts, the parent is $XDG_CACHE_HOME/ubiquitty/build, or
# ~/.cache/ubiquitty/build when XDG_CACHE_HOME is unset or relative.
#
# UBIQUITTY_DERIVED_DATA moves the whole tree; UBQ_BUILD_ROOT names one build
# root outright and skips the derivation.
#
# Scripts/build_root.py derives the identical path for python callers, and
# Scripts/check-build-root.py holds the two to agreeing: a gate fingerprinting
# one directory while the build writes to another reports a verdict about bytes
# nobody wrote.
