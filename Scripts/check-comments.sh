# Scripts/check-comments.sh — comment hygiene lint (the no-temporal-comments rule).
#
# BLOCKS on a comment attached to an #include / #import / Swift import line. The
# comment names what the header supplies, the header changes without it, and
# nothing checks the pairing — so it becomes a confident wrong answer. Say it
# once in the file-top comment instead, where it is prose rather than a claim
# about a specific symbol.
#
# BLOCKS on internal issue/PR/ticket-number references in CODE COMMENTS. A ticket
# number is temporal: it dates the code to a development moment and rots when the
# tracker moves. A comment states a present-tense invariant; the ticket lives in
# `git blame` and the PR. (Rule: Docs/coding-conventions.md §3.2.)
#
# RATCHET: the blocking modes (--staged, --since) scan only ADDED lines, so a
# legacy ref in a file you happen to touch never blocks you — only refs you write
# do. This mirrors check-acronyms.py. The full-tree backlog is reported ADVISORY
# (see the bare-invocation mode) and burned down separately; it never blocks CI.
#
# EXEMPT (not flagged):
#   - external-standard citations: UAX #29, UTS #51, RFC 1951, ECMA-48, ISO,
#     Unicode Annex, TR # — stable references, not history.
#   - terminfo-style capabilities (Co#256) and other letter-prefixed `name#NNN`.
#   - hex colors (#33ff66) and pixel sizes (#16px).
#   - single-digit enumerations (#1, #2) used as in-comment list markers.
#
# BLOCKS, in every mode, on change narration: a closed list of phrases that can
# only compare the code to an earlier version of itself (see temporal_filter).
# `used to`, `no longer` and `previously` are not on it; each also has a correct
# program-state sense, so restating them as invariants is a reading job.
#
# Deferral markers are not handled here. Scripts/check-slop.py owns them and
# blocks on them in every scanned file, source included: a marker recording work
# as postponed names no change and no owner, and the reader who needs it cannot
# act on it either way.
#
# Usage:
#   Scripts/check-comments.sh            # full tree — tickets and include comments ADVISORY
#   Scripts/check-comments.sh --staged   # staged ADDED lines (pre-commit BLOCK)
#   Scripts/check-comments.sh --since REF # ADDED lines vs REF (CI BLOCK)
#   Scripts/check-comments.sh file ...   # specific files, full content (BLOCK)
#
# Exit 0 = clean/advisory-only, 1 = a blocking finding, 2 = usage error.
#
# Wired into Scripts/hooks/pre-commit (--staged, BLOCKS) and Scripts/check-style.py
# (--since origin/main, BLOCKS the PR diff). Portable to bash 3.2 (macOS /bin/bash):
# no mapfile, no arrays.

# Change narration: a comment comparing the code to an earlier version of
# itself. It describes one commit and is false after the next ten, and the
# reader it addresses — someone who saw the previous version — does not exist.
#
# Three phrases are not checked, and naming them is the point: `used to`,
# `previously` and `no longer` each carry a second, correct sense that reads
# identically. A geometry `used to` spawn sessions is a purpose; a set
# `previously installed` is program state; panes `no longer` in the layout are a
# runtime fact, and so is a row that `now holds` what another row had. Across
# the tree those senses outnumber the narrating ones, so a rule spanning them
# rejects more correct comments than it catches, which is the gate people learn
# to skip. They are a reading job.
#
# What is left has no second reading: a phrase that can only mean "this differs
# from what was here before". "always did" and "as it always has" are such
# phrases; a comment that holds one is describing an edit, not the program.
#
# A full-line `#` comment is a comment, so the rule holds the shell scripts and
# git hooks too: those are the gates that enforce it.
#
# `this fix|change|commit|patch` is checked in C-family comments only: in a gate
# script the phrase names the change under inspection ("would any test notice if
# this change were wrong?"), not an earlier version. The rest have one reading
# in either language.
#
# Quoted spans are blanked first, so a rule quoting the phrases it forbids is
# mentioning them rather than narrating.
