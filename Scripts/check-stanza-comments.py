"""Check that a stanza comment in run-tests.sh has a stanza under it.

Every test in `Scripts/run-tests.sh` is a comment saying what the test pins,
followed by the `build_and_run` that compiles and runs it. The comment is the
only place the reason lives — the stanza itself is a compiler invocation and a
file list.

Deleting a test deletes the stanza. The comment above it has no syntax, so
nothing notices when it stays, and what is left reads exactly like coverage that
runs: a paragraph pinning an encoder whose test is gone, or describing a sweep
that never runs.

A reader planning coverage reads such a paragraph and crosses the thing off.
That is worse than silence: it is the harness describing a scope it does not
have, in the file whose subject is what the suite covers.

The rule is structural, so it needs no list of what is currently true. A comment
block inside the stanza region is followed by a stanza or by nothing, and a
block followed only by another comment block is describing something that is not
there.

Blocks that document a shell function or close the file are not stanza comments;
they sit outside the region, which runs from the first stanza to the last.

A stanza is written two ways — `build_and_run`, and `if … wanted <name>; then`
for the ones needing a platform guard or their own compiler flags. Reading only
the first form ends the region early and judges a fraction of the stanzas,
which is a walk over the population the check can see rather than the one it is
about.

Stdlib only.
