# run-coverage.sh — source-based line coverage for the host test suite.
#
# Usage:
#   ./Scripts/run-coverage.sh              build, run, write the report
#   HTML=1 ./Scripts/run-coverage.sh       also write the per-file HTML drill-down
#   ./Scripts/run-coverage.sh --gaps       print the least-covered files first
#   ./Scripts/run-coverage.sh --check N    exit non-zero below N% total line coverage
#
# One driver builds every test and the Core it exercises with the same
# instrumentation, because llvm-cov attributes a Core line to whichever test
# binary ran it: instrument only half the tree and reached lines report as
# missed.
#
# Artifacts, all under BuildHostTests/coverage/ and all consumed by something:
#   summary.txt         the per-file table; check-coverage-floor.sh reads it
#   coverage.lcov       per-line hit counts; coverage-changed-lines.py reads it
#   coverage.toolchain  llvm-cov / llvm-profdata versions, so the lcov is
#                       self-describing
#   covering-tests.tsv  which tests reach which file; check-mutants.sh reads it
#   html/index.html     per-file drill-down, with HTML=1
#
# The precompiled header is off here on purpose: force-including headers into
# TUs that never named them shifts which lines llvm-cov maps, and coverage has
# to measure the source as written.

# the same file as the table. A reader who opens summary.txt meets a percentage,
# and the sentence naming the functions it was computed in the absence of sits
# above that percentage and reaches no console.
#
# The mismatched-function count is a DUPLICATE count, not a coverage gap, and
# saying otherwise makes a sound number look untrustworthy. Every test binary
# statically links the Core it uses, all of them are passed as -object, and the
# same function therefore arrives once per binary that kept it. llvm-cov scores
# the first record and drops the rest.
#
# Measured against this build by varying the object count and holding the
# profile set fixed:
#
#     objects    functions scored    line coverage    mismatched
#           1                  40           53.06%            53
#          16               1,526           86.63%           349
#          64               2,213           85.72%         2,000
#         304               3,826           85.21%        10,025
#
# The scored set GROWS with the object count — it is the union across binaries,
# and no single binary holds all of Core because each one drops what it never
# references. The mismatch count grows at roughly a constant rate per object,
# which is what a duplicate does and what a missing function does not.
#
# That holds for the TOTAL. It does not hold per file when the code is inline in
# a header, and the difference is large enough to invert a reading:
#
#     Source/Core/Rendering/CursorMotion.h
#       its own test's object + profile   118 lines,   6 missed   94.92%
#       this whole-tree report            152 lines, 123 missed   19.08%
#
# `test_cursor_motion` calls update() 37 times across all four modes. The record
# that survived came from an object that includes the header and never runs it —
# a different TU sees a different line set, which is why even the denominators
# disagree. llvm-cov keeps the first record for a name and drops the rest, and
# nothing in the report says which object it kept.
#
# So a per-file number for a header is a statement about one arbitrary TU. To get
# the real one for a single file, run llvm-cov against the object of a test that
# exercises it — Tests/coverage/covering-tests.tsv names those tests:
#
#     llvm-cov report -object <build>/Tests/<test> -instr-profile <that test's profile>
#
# A .cpp is not exposed the same way: its code compiles into one object, so there
# is one record and nothing to choose between.
