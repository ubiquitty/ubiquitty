# check-pgo-profile-consumer.sh — the profile is only handed to a reader of it.
#
# Support/pgo carries LLVM's IR-instrumentation format, which only clang reads.
# GCC's -fprofile-use takes a DIRECTORY of .gcda files, so handed a .profdata
# path it resolves `<path>/<object>.gcda`, finds nothing, emits one
# -Wmissing-profile, and COMPILES ANYWAY. Exit 0. The binary is a plain -O3
# build, and every status line above it in the log says profile-guided.
#
# That is why this is a gate and not a comment. The failure is silent by
# construction: it produces a working binary, a green build, and a number that
# is quietly off on the lanes the profile was measured on. Nothing else
# in the tree would notice -- not the compiler, not the tests, not a reviewer
# reading a diff that adds a flag which is correct on the machine they run.
#
# Two things are checked, because the flag is added from two places:
#
#   the shell path   Scripts/pgo-flags.sh decides for the bash builders, and
#                    its own --self-test proves the decision.
#   the CMake path   the block in CMakeLists.txt must gate on the compiler's
#                    identity, and then ask that compiler whether it reads the
#                    profile (ubiquitty_compiler_reads_profile) before adding the
#                    flag. Without the first, every GCC Release build is a silent
#                    no-op. Without the second, a clang older than the
#                    llvm-profdata that wrote the profile fails every
#                    translation unit on "unsupported instrumentation profile
#                    format version", which is the stock Ubuntu 24.04 clang.
