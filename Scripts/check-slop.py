"""check-slop.py — prose that performs understanding instead of carrying it.

Six rules. Each names a sentence shape that reads as explanation and holds none.
They are separate because they fail differently, are fixed differently, and a
per-rule count says which habit is growing.

    vouching    asserts a quality whose only evidence is the author claiming it
    metaphor    a figure of speech standing where a reason belongs
    hedging     announces significance instead of stating it
    rhetoric    a question or reveal staged for an audience that is not present
    marketing   adjectives from a product page
    deferral    work recorded as postponed instead of done
    shouting    capitals doing the work a sentence should do

Every rule blocks at zero. A budget of permitted violations is unfinished work
handed to the next reader, and the count it settles at is the count it keeps: a
rule held as written-down guidance with no check accumulates sites under it.

DEFERRAL is the rule that matters most, because it is how giving up gets
recorded. "for now", "we could", "a follow-up change will" — each reads as a
plan and commits no one to anything. There is no reader for whom the sentence is
actionable. Either the work belongs in this change, and the sentence is replaced
by the work, or it does not, and the sentence is deleted.

    // Only US QWERTY for now; other layouts later.
    // US QWERTY only. A non-US layout needs the kernel's keymap ioctl, which
    // this driver does not open.

The two are the same length. One of them tells a reader what would have to be
true.

WHY A LIST OF WORDS AND NOT A JUDGEMENT. The defect is a sentence shape and no
word list closes it. What a list does is hold the shapes that were counted, so a
habit cannot regrow silently while everyone agrees it is bad.

TWO WORDS ARE SPELLED THE SAME AND ARE NOT THE SAME WORD, and each is
distinguished by the phrase around it, never by dropping the rule:

    a C++ object "goes out of scope"        a lifetime, not a plan
    a caller "may pass a temporary"         a value category, not a stopgap

That is the only kind of distinction this file makes. A word is NOT excused for
being frequent. Frequency is what a habit looks like, and reading a large count
as evidence that the usage is this codebase's vocabulary is how every one of
these rules would exempt itself.

WHAT IS NOT PROSE. Code is not addressed to a reader, so only comments,
Markdown, and Python docstrings are scanned; a string literal is the program's
payload. Contents are blanked rather than dropped so a finding still reports the
line it is on. The pattern list below sits in code and is blanked with it, and
this file's module docstring is blanked too — a check has to name what it
rejects, and exempting the path by name would exempt every line added to it
afterwards.

    python3 Scripts/check-slop.py
    python3 Scripts/check-slop.py --self-test        the scan's own scope
    python3 Scripts/check-slop.py --staged           the staged files only
    python3 Scripts/check-slop.py --rule deferral    one rule, for a sweep
    python3 Scripts/check-slop.py --message FILE     a commit message

A COMMIT MESSAGE IS WHERE DEFERRAL ACTUALLY GETS WRITTEN, so --message reads one
and applies the deferral rule plus the promises that only appear there: work
parked in a branch, a follow-up nobody is assigned, a next PR that does not
exist. A comment saying `for now` at least sits beside the code it defers; a
commit message saying it addresses nothing at all, because the message is read
once and then only by `git log`.

Scoping is NOT deferral and is not rejected. "This covers the CSI table; the C0
rows are keyed on a code position and are not compared" states a boundary of
what was built, which is what an honest message owes a reader. What the rule
rejects is a FUTURE-TENSE PROMISE about work with no owner and no change behind
it — the two are told apart by tense, and a sentence that names no future does
not match.

# Shouting is caught on the CLOSED CLASS — function words, auxiliaries,
# pronouns, prepositions — and never on content words. That distinction is what
# separates a raised voice from a name: this is a terminal emulator, so OSC,
# `HELLO`, `SNAPSHOT`, `CUP` and `BEL` are all-caps because that is their
# spelling, and a
# dictionary cannot tell them from a shouted noun. A closed class can, because
# English does not coin new prepositions. No token outside this list is judged,
# which leaves a lone shouted noun uncaught, and that boundary is stated
# rather than implied: the
# alternative needs a list of every acronym in the tree, and 1,271 of them are
# in prose today.
#
# Two spellings here are not English at all:
#
#   `YES` / `NO` in .m, .mm   the Objective-C boolean literals
#   `OR'd`, `AND-gate`        the bitwise operator as a verb or a compound
#   `OR of`, `OR over`        the bitwise operator folded across a range
#   `AT-SPI`, `NO-OP`         a closed-class word inside a hyphenated acronym
#   `ESC CAN`, `CAN / SUB`    the ASCII control character 0x18, not the modal verb
#   `0x18 (CAN)`              the same character named after its own byte value
#
# `CAN` is the same collision as `AT`, told apart by what sits beside it. Its C0
# siblings are unaffected because none of them is also an English word: NUL, BEL,
# SUB, ENQ, ETX and SOH appear in capitals throughout the tree. Judging `CAN`
# alone would make this one control character the only member of that set a
# comment has to spell in lowercase, so the gate would be editing the vocabulary
# rather than the voice.
#
# The boundary, stated: a genuinely shouted `CAN` immediately after `ESC ` or
# `0x18 (`, or immediately before `/ SUB`, goes uncaught. None of the three is a
# sentence.
#
# The last one is why every entry carries a `(?!['\-])` lookahead rather than
# only the operators. `AT` is a preposition and the first half of the Linux
# accessibility protocol's name, and a rule that judges the token without
# looking at what follows it rewrites the protocol.
#
# The cost is stated rather than hidden: a genuinely shouted hyphenated phrase
# goes uncaught. Telling `BYTE-FOR-BYTE` from `AT-SPI` needs to know which
# halves are English, and that needs a word list — which the Linux container
# has no copy of, so the gate would pass there for the wrong reason.
#
# `XOR` is absent from the list entirely: it is not an English word in any
# spelling, so every occurrence is the operator.
#
# `SO` is absent for the opposite reason. It is an English word, and in this
# codebase it is overwhelmingly not one. Shift Out is C0 0x0E, and of the 19
# occurrences the first sweep touched, 18 named the control and 1 was a shouted
# conjunction — which still trips on `THE`, `IS` and `IT` in the same phrase, so
# the rule loses nothing by dropping it. A word whose domain sense outnumbers
# its English sense 18 to 1 rewrites vocabulary rather than voice.
#
# Both are the language quoted rather than the voice raised, and both are told
# apart by what sits beside them, not by a path.
