"""check-wire-version-pins.py — what quotes the wire's numbers tracks them.

`Sync/Envelope.h` holds the one wire version this build speaks; two peers
connect only when they speak the same one. A client written in C++ includes
the header. The Emacs and Neovim
clients read the files `Scripts/gen-wire-tables.py` writes from the headers,
which `Scripts/check-wire-tables.py` holds current, so neither types a version,
a kind or a capability bit of its own. This gate holds what that generation
cannot cover.

There is one version and no history of versions: a change to the wire edits
that version's grammar, and a peer at any other version is refused. The gate
fails when the version headers name a minimum peer version or a version
history again.

A body version is only a version if somebody reads it back, so every
`*BodyVersion` constant `Sync/HandoverBody.h` declares has to be both stamped onto a
frame and compared off one.

Protocol references name authoritative version symbols and generated tables,
not the version a particular build currently speaks. DOC_REFERENCES holds those
links; copied current-version claims are rejected. HEADER_CLAIMS holds the
numeric bounds in `Docs/sync-protocol.md` against their header constants. A size
claim names its unit, so the byte constant is compared in the unit the sentence uses
and a constant that does not divide into it fails rather than rounding. A
constant reached through an alias is resolved, not skipped: `maxClipboardServeBytes`
is `Transport::guaranteedOutboundFrameBytes`, which lives in another header, and
a claim pinned to a name that evaluates to nothing would pass against nothing. A
reworded sentence stops matching and fails, so a claim that moves out from
under its check is registered again and never goes unread.

Each editor still keeps a few tables no header declares, written in the
generated names: the kinds a host sends that the client reads past, and the
Emacs client's choice of which key each Emacs event is sent as. Those are held
here to the enumerations they name: an unsolicited kind is one a host sends,
and a forwarded key is a `Keys::VirtualKey`.

Stdlib only.

    A version byte is only a version if somebody reads it back. ROWDELTA's was
    stamped by the encoder and discarded by both C++ readers while the two
    hand-written clients compared their own copies, so a peer one layout ahead
    was refused by them and taken here — walked field by field at another
    layout's offsets. REQUEST_KEYFRAME's was the same, on a body small enough
    that nobody expected it to grow, which is the body a field gets appended to.

    So the rule is: a `*BodyVersion` constant the header declares has to be both
    stamped and read back against. Reading the constants from the header rather
    than a list means a new frame's version is held to it the day it is named.

    Any comparison counts. IMAGE takes a range — `version < 1 || version >
    imageBodyVersion` — so a peer still writing v1 has its frames decoded rather
    than refused, which is what a layout that is still readable wants. A rule
    demanding equality would have named that frame and pushed it toward refusing
    those peers. What the rule is about is whether the byte is consulted, not how.

    - Parameters:
      - headerText: Sync/HandoverBody.h, which declares the constants.
