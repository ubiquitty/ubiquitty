"""check-findings-on-board.py — a finding is tracked on the board, not in a doc.

A sweep's findings are board items, each carrying its own evidence, verdict and
resolution. The board answers "what is left" by being queried; a catalogue in the
tree answers it by being kept in step by hand, and needs a second file listing
which of its entries are done.

Prose is not a catalogue. A design doc citing a finding by number is how a reader
follows a decision back to its cause. So the rule is a threshold: a handful of
references is a document that mentions findings, and a file carrying THRESHOLD or
more numbered finding headings — or that many burn-down checkboxes — is a
document that has become the tracker.

Stdlib only.
