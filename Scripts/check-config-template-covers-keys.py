"""check-config-template-covers-keys.py — the shipped reference lists the keys.

`Source/Core/Preferences/PreferencesFileTemplate.cpp` writes the default TOML the app
ships, and says twice what that file is for:

    "its built-in default, so the file doubles as the reference for what can be set"
    "Every supported key appears once, commented, at its built-in default."

`Key.h` is not the list of settings, and reading it as one is easy: it
calls itself the "declarative WRITE recipe for every settings key a frontend
persists", so it holds what a UI control writes back. The read side is a separate
table in `Preferences.cpp` with 154 entries, and 32 of those are parseable with no row
here — `security.osc_allow`, `render.max_fps`, `keys.compose_key` and the rest of
what has no toggle. Nothing is lost by that: a frontend writes one key at a time
through `Preferences::writeKeyValue`, which patches the file rather than rewriting it,
so a hand-written key with no UI survives a UI write.

This gate is the write side only. That every DOCUMENTED key is a real one is the
other direction, and `Tests/Core/Preferences/test_preferences_template_parses.cpp` holds it
by parsing each in Strict mode.

Every key `Key.h` persists appears in the template under its own section.
Adding a row to the key table gives nobody a reason to touch the template, and
nothing else compares the two, so each omission is invisible alone and only a
count over the whole table shows the gap.

A key is looked for under its own section, because names are not unique across
sections: a match anywhere credits `quake.enabled` with the line documenting
`notifications.enabled`, `control.enable` with the one under `# [scripting]`,
and `control.token` with prose about a "BCP-47-style token".

Prose naming a key under its own heading counts, as a commented assignment
does: a reader cannot set a key whose name is nowhere in the reference. The
`title.pane_*` keys are named that way, with their inheritance rule and no
value, because an unset pane flag does not fall back to a value:
`paneTitleComposition` inherits the RESOLVED tab flag, except dimensions where
unset means off, so `# pane_directory = true` would name a default the pane
does not have.

A key's description is written wherever someone had to explain the feature,
which is rarely the config headers: `SettingsCatalog.swift` carries a title and
a detail paragraph for every setting with a toggle, `Docs/control-socket.md`
ships the `[control]` block, and the defaults of the `[title]` flags are in
`Preferences.cpp`'s constructor initialiser list rather than in
`PreferencesDefaults.h`. A transcription into the template starts from those.

KNOWN_ABSENT records any key the template does not name, so the gap cannot
grow: a key missing beyond it fails, and a recorded key that reaches the
template fails too, naming itself for deletion from the list. The record cannot
outlive its subject, which is what separates it from an allowlist that survives
the condition it excused.

Stdlib only.
