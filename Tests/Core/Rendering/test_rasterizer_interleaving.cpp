// test_rasterizer_interleaving — a raster of one glyph does not depend on what
// was rasterised before it.
//
// The seam hands every backend one `GlyphRasterizer&`, and a backend calls it in
// whatever order its rows fault. Nothing in the contract says an implementation
// may not keep state between calls, and one that does turns "which glyph" into
// "which glyph, after which other glyph" — a property no per-glyph correctness
// case can see, because each of those rasterises one glyph into a fresh buffer
// and asks whether the pixels are right.
//
// The failure this exists for was measured on the web seam
// (Source/Platform/Web/WebFontRasterizer.cpp): the colour path set `textAlign`
// on a shared 2D context and the mono path never reset it, so every glyph
// rasterised after any emoji was drawn half an advance to the left. It reached
// the ATLAS, so it stayed wrong for as long as the slot did, and it surfaced
// three layers downstream as a parity disagreement whose sign was inverted by
// which arm rasterised first.
//
// The property is one sentence and it holds for every implementation: rasterise
// A, rasterise B, rasterise A again, and the two A rasters agree byte for byte.
