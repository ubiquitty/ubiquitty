# test-toolchain-floor.sh — a compiler below the floor is refused by name, and
# the training profile goes only to a compiler that reads it.
#
#   configure  Scripts/cmake/ToolchainFloor.cmake refuses GCC 13 and Clang 18
#              with the remedy and admits GCC 14, Clang 19 and AppleClang. The
#              compiler identity is passed as data through `cmake -P`, so no old
#              compiler has to be installed for the refusal to be exercised.
#              Then the tree itself is configured with a compiler stated to be
#              GCC 13.3 and must stop at the floor, which is what fails if
#              CMakeLists.txt stops calling the function.
#   header     Base/Types.h carries Base/ToolchainFloor.h: a C++20 compile of it
#              fails naming C++23, and a standard library whose <version> does
#              not announce std::expected fails naming std::expected. That second
#              case is the Clang 18 over libstdc++ shape, where <expected> exists
#              and is empty, so header presence would have admitted it.
#   profile    ubiquitty_compiler_reads_profile admits a profile the compiler's
#              own llvm-profdata wrote and refuses one it cannot read. Then a
#              Release configure of the tree, with a clang the floor admits,
#              hands no translation unit a profile that clang cannot read and
#              hands every one a profile it can. It needs a clang and that
#              clang's llvm-profdata, and the tree configure needs that clang to
#              clear the floor. Without them the arm says SKIPPED by name, and
#              the other two still decide the verdict.
