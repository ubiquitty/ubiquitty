# Tests/git-fixture.sh — make a throwaway repository that is certainly throwaway.
#
# `git init` in a directory does not necessarily create a repository there. GIT_DIR
# names a repository outright and overrides discovery, so with it set,
# `git -C /some/scratch/dir init` re-initialises the repository GIT_DIR names,
# creates nothing at the path given, and exits 0. Every later `git -C` in that
# directory then runs with someone else's git directory and this fixture's files
# as its work tree.
#
# Git exports GIT_DIR into a hook's environment when a push originates from a
# LINKED WORKTREE — and only then, which is why it never shows up in ordinary
# use. A push from a worktree runs the suite through pre-push ->
# pre-push-gates.sh -> ctest -> run-tests.sh, none of which clears the
# environment, so an unguarded fixture commits to the pusher's branch, creates
# a branch there, resets it, and writes the fixture's `user.email` into the
# repo's shared config.
#
# Two defences, because the first one cannot be complete:
#
#   The environment is cleared. That handles every variable known today.
#
#   The result is CHECKED. A fixture asserts its git directory is inside itself
#   before anything is committed, so an escape by some future variable, or by a
#   mechanism nobody has thought of, stops here instead of at someone's branch.
#
# The second is the one that matters. Every guard in this tree checks that a
# command failed; this one exists because the command SUCCEEDED and did something
# else. A setup step that reports success while acting elsewhere is invisible to
# exit statuses, to `set -e`, and to every assertion written about the result.
#

# Removes the inherited git environment from this shell and everything it spawns.
