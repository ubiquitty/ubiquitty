// The Rule-10 negative probe. It is compiled with the model layer's stage as its
// only include directory.
//
// Each test uses __has_include rather than #include. An #include fails as soon
// as any header it pulls in is missing, so a boundary that holds and a header
// that drags in something unstaged would fail the same way and tell nothing
// apart. __has_include asks the one question that matters: whether the model
// stage can reach the behaviour header at all.
